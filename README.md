什么是 NDIS

### Build good relationship with clients

- I always treat clients with dignity, listening to their feelings and needs with a kind and patient attitude to make them feel valued.
- I use simple, friendly language and non-verbal cues like smiles or gestures, especially for clients with language barriers, to ensure they understand and feel comfortable.
- I take time to know their likes, dislikes, and background, such as asking about their favorite foods or hobbies, to personalize their care and build trust.
- I show up on time, follow their care plan, and keep promises, like preparing a meal they enjoy, so they know they can depend on me.
- I involve them in activities they love, like chatting about their favorite topics or helping with a hobby, to create positive, meaningful moments.
- I encourage their independence by offering choices, like asking if they prefer a shower now or later, showing I respect their decisions.
- I pay attention to their mood or health changes and adjust my approach, reporting concerns to my team to ensure their well-being.

For example, with a Chinese client, I might use my knowledge of their culture, like offering familiar dishes or greetings in Mandarin, to make them feel at home and strengthen our bond.

### Safely transport a patient

- I'd review the client’s care plan to know their mobility needs, like if they use a wheelchair or need extra support.
- I ensure the vehicle is safe, check wheelchair locks or seat belts, and use aids like transfer belts if needed.
- I'd follow manual handling procedures, bending my knees and moving slowly, to help the client in and out of the vehicle safely.
- I'd explain each step to keep the client calm, aware, and reduce stress.
- I'd watch for signs of discomfort or distress while driving, ensuring the client's is safety and comfort.
- If any thing unexpected happened, I'd document and report it to my supervisor.

### Manual Handling

你对搬运技巧了解多少？

Manual handling in aged care is about safely moving or supporting clients, like helping them walk, sit, or get out of bed. It also includes moving objects, like lifting a chair or carrying supplies.

- Before moving a client, I’d check their care plan for mobility needs or restrictions, like if they need a walker or have a recent injury. I’d also assess the environment for hazards, like clutter or wet floors, to ensure it’s safe.
- I’d explain what I’m doing to make them feel comfortable, saying, “I’m going to help you stand now – let me know if anything feels off.” I’d ask if they’re ready and encourage them to do as much as they can to maintain independence.
- I’d use techniques from my training, like bending my knees, keeping my back straight, and holding the client close to my body for stability. For example, when helping someone stand, I’d support them under their arms, not pulling on their wrists.
- If a client needs more support, I’d use aids like hoists, slide sheets, or transfer belts, following the facility’s training. For instance, with a hoist, I’d check it’s in good condition and position it correctly before lifting.
- For complex transfers, like moving a client from bed to a wheelchair, I’d ask a colleague for help if the care plan requires two people. I’d coordinate by saying, “Let’s lift on three – ready?”
- I’d watch for signs of discomfort during the task and stop if the client seems in pain. If something doesn’t work, I’d try a different approach or consult my supervisor. For example, if a client struggles to stand, I’d check if they need a different aid.
- After assisting, I’d record any issues, like if the client felt unsteady, in their care notes. If I notice a new mobility concern, I’d report it to my supervisor to update the care plan.
- I’d stick to the manual handling training from my Certificate III and the facility’s policies, which align with Australia’s Work Health and Safety regulations and Aged Care Standards. If I’m unsure, I’d ask for a refresher or guidance.

During my placement, I helped clients with tasks like transferring from bed to chair using a slide sheet or supporting them while walking with a walker. My steady personality helps me stay focused, and my habit of keeping spaces tidy ensures the environment is clear of trip hazards. I also prioritize the client’s dignity, making sure they feel secure and respected during any manual handling task.

### How do you handle conflict with colleagues?

As a Support Worker, I think there are two kinds of conflicts: conflict with clients or their families and conflict with colleagues. I'll give two examples of how I handle these two different situations.

#### 1. Conflict with Clients or Their Family

Situation: During my placement, I provided mobility assistance for a client living with dementia who had limited mobility. His wife was dissatisfied with the walking time we provided. She believed we should increase her husband's daily activity.

Task: My task was to address her concerns and ensure the client's safety while finding a safe and reasonable way to adjust the client's walking time.

Action:
I took these steps:

- First, I stayed calm. I listened to her carefully without arguing and showed understanding for her concerns.
- I used de-escalating techniques: I kept a gentle tone, maintained a comfortable distance, and focused on the issue rather than emotions.
- I explained our current plan: “We walk him 20 minutes twice a day in the morning and afternoon, but we’re happy to explore adjustments if it’s safe.”
- With the involvement of the nurse, we agreed to increase the client's walking time safely.
- I documented and reported the incident to my supervisor, and updated the client’s care plan.

Result: The result was that the client received more beneficial exercise safely and the wife was satisfied about the adjustment. From this experience, I learned the importance of communication and person-centered approaches.

#### 2. Conflict with Colleagues

Situation: Imagine I am working with a colleague in the kitchen, and they tell me they are too busy to complete the **light housekeeping** or **laundry and linen care** duties assigned to them. They ask me to do their tasks instead.

Task: My task is to ensure that all tasks are completed efficiently for client safety and comfort, but also to maintain professional **teamwork** without encouraging them to avoid their responsibilities.

Action:
I'd handle this privately and diplomatically

- I'd speak to my colleague alone and use a **calm** and **objective** tone. I'd focus on the tasks, not the person. I'd say: 'I understand you are busy, but the linen for Client X must be changed today for **infection prevention and control**.'
- I'd offer to **collaborate** by saying: 'If I finish **assisted feeding** for Client Y now, can we work together to finish the laundry quickly?' [2]
- If the essential tasks still cannot be completed, I'd **report** the time management issue to the supervisor. This is not about blame; it is about ensuring **client safety** is not compromised due to unfinished work." [5]

Result: By focusing on **collaboration** and **prioritizing** the client's needs (like infection control), we would complete the necessary tasks and maintain a professional working relationship.

Case 2: Conflict with a Colleague

Situation: During a busy shift, a colleague and I disagreed about tasks for a client. We both thought we should attend to the same client first. This led to tension and a brief argument between us.
Task: My task was to resolve the misunderstanding quickly so the client’s care would not be affected, and to maintain a respectful working relationship with my colleague.
Action:

  1. I asked my colleague if we could talk privately, away from the client.
  2. I listened to her concerns, then calmly explained why I had started the task.
  3. We realized there was confusion in our schedule, so we reviewed the care plan and decided who would do which tasks. 
  4. We agreed that I'd finish helping this client and she would start another urgent task.
  5. I thanked her for working together to find a solution.
Result: By communicating calmly and sharing tasks, we both felt respected and the client was helped promptly. The conflict was resolved professionally, and we learned to coordinate better to avoid confusion in future shifts.

#### How do you practice duty of care?

- I must ensure the client's environment is safe and follow manual handling procedures when lifting or moving a client to prevent falls or injuries to them and myself.
- I must ensure the client's dignity, privacy, and quality of life while providing care, such as ensuring curtains are closed during personal care.
- I must follow the client's care plan and the facility's Work Health and Safety (WHS) procedures.
- If I see a change in a client's health (like a new bruise, fever, or confusion), I have a duty to report it to my supervisor or the Registered Nurse. Otherwise, it is a breach of my duty of care.

#### What is the relevance of duty of care in aged care?

A duty of care outlines standards of reasonable and appropriate care. It also provides a legal basis for determining how to make the best decisions regarding the care of a person with disability.

<!-- Reference: Reference: CHCDIS020 -->

#### Support workers' duty of care

Support workers' duty of care includes eight obligations:

- Providing safe and high-quality service
- Treating people with dignity and respect
- Preventing abuse and neglect
- Protecting people's privacy
- Informing people about their care
- Helping people maintain independence
- Giving people control over their decisions
- Listening to people's opinions and feedback

#### What is the support worker's duty of care in relation to dignity of risk?

It is the disability support worker’s duty of care to ensure that the person they are supporting is able to live their life however they choose while maintaining their health and safety (as far as reasonably practicable).

<!-- Reference: CHCDIS020 -->

#### Examples to reduce the risks

Support workers can develop ways to honour clients' dignity of risk while protecting their well-being. Here are some ways to reduce the risks:

- Situation: A person wants to continue living alone despite their mobility issues.
- Result: They may hurt themselves without anyone there to help them.
- Suggestions:
  - Ask them to always keep an emergency cell phone with them. They can use it to call for help in case of emergencies.
  - Schedule more frequent check-ins and home visits.
  - Ask one of their neighbours to check in on them at least once a day.
  
- Situation: A person wants to continue using a cane instead of a wheelchair.
- Result: There is a greater risk of falling and injury when using a cane.
- Suggestions:
  - Ask them if they agree to have physical therapy to strengthen their arms and legs. This would make it safer for them to use a cane because they will be more stable.
  - Make sure they have a sturdy, stable, and comfortable cane to use.

- Situation: A person does not want to receive a flu vaccine.
- Result: They are at a higher risk of a serious flu infection.
- Suggestions:
  - Monitor their health more closely.
  - Minimise their potential exposure to the flu.

#### What is an individualised plan?

individualised plans detail an old person’s medical and care information and what services or lifestyle modifications they may need to address their individual needs.

Individual plans are vital because they are tailored to each person. It ensures that older people do not just receive generic services that do not fit their needs. It also enables them to decide when and how to receive services.

#### Contents

A person’s individualised plan contains the following information:

- Basic information
- Current medical needs
- Care needs
- Goals and preferences
- Members of care team
- Services being availed
- Assessment results
- Family or carer contact information

#### Purpose

Individualised plan serves as a guide.

A person’s individualised plan serves the following purposes:

- Tells the team basic and medical information about the person
- Tells each aged care worker what to do for the person and when to do it
- Serves as a record of the person’s goals and progress
- Serves as an agreement between the person and the care provider

#### What is Mandatory Reporting?

Mandatory reporting is a legal obligation to report any reasonable belief of abuse to the proper authorities. Any person with a duty of care over a person with disability must determine whether the person with disability needs immediate help or is suffering from significant harm.

Mandatory reporting is the responsibility of reporting suspected instances of abuse. Professionals like teachers, medical workers and care workers all have this responsibility. When it comes to aged care, mandatory reporting enables older people to be protected from indicators and allegations of exploitation, abuse, harassment and neglect. 

As an aged care worker, you should know the mandatory reporting laws that apply to aged care. Familiarise yourself with the reporting policies and procedures of your workplace. This will help you protect the rights of the older people in your care.

The Aged Care Act 1997 defines a reportable incident as the occurrence, or suspected occurrence, of abuse, including: 

- Unreasonable use of force
- Unlawful sexual contact or inappropriate sexual conduct
- Psychological or emotional abuse
- Stealing done by an aged care worker
- Unexpected death of the residential care recipient
- Neglect
- Unreasonable use of restrictive practices
- Unexplained absence of the residential care recipient from the residential care services of the provider

Aged care workers must report these cases to the proper authorities. Aged care providers must respond to these reports quickly and efficiently. There must be a record of each report, including what was done to address it.

Mandatory reporting is related to your duty of care as an aged care worker. You must ensure that any reasonable belief of abuse to the older person you are supporting is reported to the proper authorities. 

If you have spotted any indicator of abuse or neglect in the older person, reach out immediately for help from authorities. Remember that mandatory reporting plays a vital role in preventing and stopping the harm that abuse, harassment and neglect can bring to older people.

#### What is the support workers duty of care in relation to mandatory reporting?

Its role is to enable persons with disability to be protected from indicators and allegations of exploitation, abuse, harassment, and neglect.

What is Duty of Care?

The concept of Duty of Care is a foundational legal and ethical principle in Australian aged care and disability support, which mandates that a Support Worker must take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harm to the individual under their care.

Duty of Care is defined by three core obligations:

1. Legal Obligation to Prevent Harm

   This is the primary legal responsibility to ensure the client is safe and that services are provided competently and with skill.

   - Providing personal care and assistance with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in a safe and skilled manner.
   - Creating and maintaining a safe and supportive environment and monitoring the older person's health and wellbeing.
   - Promptly responding to any changes in a client's condition or concerns about matters that may impact the quality and safety of supports.

2. Ethical Obligation to Uphold Dignity and Choice

   In modern aged care, the Duty of Care is defined as providing a high standard of care that meets the person's assessed needs while upholding their rights, identity, and choices.

   - Treating the client with dignity and respect, and ensuring they live without abuse or neglect.
   - Respecting the individual’s right to self-determination and decision-making, and ensuring they are informed about their care in a way they understand.

3. Balancing Safety with Independence (Dignity of Risk)

   A critical component of the modern Duty of Care is supporting the individual’s Dignity of Risk. It is understood that empowering people to make informed choices is essential for maintaining independence and quality of life.

   - Allowing clients to have control over and make choices about their personal and social life, even when those choices involve a personal risk, provided that risk is calculated and the client is informed and understands the potential consequences.
   - Actively promoting independence and building the client's skills and confidence, rather than taking over tasks they can do for themselves. This ensures the support worker is reducing vulnerability by increasing independence, which is itself a safety measure.
   - When a safety concern arises regarding a client’s choice, the Support Worker's duty is to discuss the potential risks openly, document the client's informed decision, and work with the clinical team to identify alternative, safer ways for the client to achieve their goal, rather than simply removing their choice.

What is Dignity of Risk?

Dignity of Risk is a fundamental principle of Person-Centred Care in the Australian aged care and disability sectors. It is the ethical imperative to support a client’s right to make informed decisions and choices about their life and daily activities, even when those choices carry an element of calculated or potential risk, in order to maintain their independence and quality of life.

This principle is recognized as an integral component of the Support Worker’s Duty of Care. Modern practice dictates that empowering clients to make informed choices is the best way to maintain their safety, build confidence, and reduce vulnerability by increasing independence.

### Support Worker’s Approach to Dignity of Risk (Steps)

When a client expresses a preference or choice that involves a risk (e.g., wanting to walk unassisted despite a fall risk, or choosing a potentially unhealthy meal), the Support Worker must not arbitrarily remove that choice. Instead, you must follow a structured, ethical process:

1. Provide Timely and Tailored Information

   Your first responsibility is to ensure the client understands the situation and the potential consequences of their choice.[1]

   - Clearly and sensitively discuss the identified risks associated with their choice (e.g., "While I support you wanting to walk to the kitchen, the physiotherapist noted a high fall risk on this type of flooring. Are you aware of the potential for a fall?").
   - Provide information in a way the client can fully understand, allowing them time to process the information and ask questions.[1]

2. Respect and Document the Choice

   If the client, having been informed of the risk, still wishes to proceed, their choice must be respected to uphold their autonomy.

   - Document the client’s informed decision in their file or progress notes, noting that the risks were discussed and understood by the client.
   - This documentation is essential for quality and safety compliance and demonstrates that your organisation has supported the client to exercise their choice.

3. Implement Risk Mitigation and Collaborate

   The goal is to support the choice while actively reducing the chance of harm.

   - Work with the client to identify the *safest possible method* to execute their choice. For example, if they insist on walking, offer standby assistance or ensure appropriate aids (like a walker or transfer belt) are available and used correctly.
   - Promptly report the situation to your supervisor, the Registered Nurse, or the clinical team. This collaboration ensures the multidisciplinary team (e.g., Occupational Therapist, Physiotherapist) can be involved to identify alternative, safer support strategies that still allow the client to achieve their goal.[1]
   - Focus on building the client’s skills and confidence, rather than taking over the task, thereby promoting independence and reducing vulnerability.

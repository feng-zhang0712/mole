What is Duty of Care?

The concept of Duty of Care is a foundational legal and ethical principle in Australian aged care and disability support, which mandates that a Support Worker must take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harm to the individual under their care.

Duty of Care is defined by three core obligations:

1. Legal Obligation to Prevent Harm

   This is the primary legal responsibility to ensure the client is safe and that services are provided competently and with skill.

   - Providing personal care and assistance with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in a safe and skilled manner.
   - Creating and maintaining a safe and supportive environment and monitoring the older person's health and wellbeing.
   - Promptly responding to any changes in a client's condition or concerns about matters that may impact the quality and safety of supports.

2. Ethical Obligation to Uphold Dignity and Choice

   In modern aged care, the Duty of Care is defined as providing a high standard of care that meets the person's assessed needs while upholding their rights, identity, and choices.

   - Treating the client with dignity and respect, and ensuring they live without abuse or neglect.
   - Respecting the individual’s right to self-determination and decision-making, and ensuring they are informed about their care in a way they understand.

3. Balancing Safety with Independence (Dignity of Risk)

   A critical component of the modern Duty of Care is supporting the individual’s Dignity of Risk. It is understood that empowering people to make informed choices is essential for maintaining independence and quality of life.

   - Allowing clients to have control over and make choices about their personal and social life, even when those choices involve a personal risk, provided that risk is calculated and the client is informed and understands the potential consequences.
   - Actively promoting independence and building the client's skills and confidence, rather than taking over tasks they can do for themselves. This ensures the support worker is reducing vulnerability by increasing independence, which is itself a safety measure.
   - When a safety concern arises regarding a client’s choice, the Support Worker's duty is to discuss the potential risks openly, document the client's informed decision, and work with the clinical team to identify alternative, safer ways for the client to achieve their goal, rather than simply removing their choice.

What is Dignity of Risk?

Dignity of Risk is a fundamental principle of Person-Centred Care in the Australian aged care and disability sectors. It is the ethical imperative to support a client’s right to make informed decisions and choices about their life and daily activities, even when those choices carry an element of calculated or potential risk, in order to maintain their independence and quality of life.

This principle is recognized as an integral component of the Support Worker’s Duty of Care. Modern practice dictates that empowering clients to make informed choices is the best way to maintain their safety, build confidence, and reduce vulnerability by increasing independence.

### Support Worker’s Approach to Dignity of Risk (Steps)

When a client expresses a preference or choice that involves a risk (e.g., wanting to walk unassisted despite a fall risk, or choosing a potentially unhealthy meal), the Support Worker must not arbitrarily remove that choice. Instead, you must follow a structured, ethical process:

1. Provide Timely and Tailored Information

   Your first responsibility is to ensure the client understands the situation and the potential consequences of their choice.[1]

   - Clearly and sensitively discuss the identified risks associated with their choice (e.g., "While I support you wanting to walk to the kitchen, the physiotherapist noted a high fall risk on this type of flooring. Are you aware of the potential for a fall?").
   - Provide information in a way the client can fully understand, allowing them time to process the information and ask questions.[1]

2. Respect and Document the Choice

   If the client, having been informed of the risk, still wishes to proceed, their choice must be respected to uphold their autonomy.

   - Document the client’s informed decision in their file or progress notes, noting that the risks were discussed and understood by the client.
   - This documentation is essential for quality and safety compliance and demonstrates that your organisation has supported the client to exercise their choice.

3. Implement Risk Mitigation and Collaborate

   The goal is to support the choice while actively reducing the chance of harm.

   - Work with the client to identify the *safest possible method* to execute their choice. For example, if they insist on walking, offer standby assistance or ensure appropriate aids (like a walker or transfer belt) are available and used correctly.
   - Promptly report the situation to your supervisor, the Registered Nurse, or the clinical team. This collaboration ensures the multidisciplinary team (e.g., Occupational Therapist, Physiotherapist) can be involved to identify alternative, safer support strategies that still allow the client to achieve their goal.[1]
   - Focus on building the client’s skills and confidence, rather than taking over the task, thereby promoting independence and reducing vulnerability.

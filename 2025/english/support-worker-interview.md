## 四、以人为本护理与客户关系

### How do you think of aged care or support worker?（*）

你对老年护理的理解是什么？（*）

- I see aged care and support work as a deeply meaningful role focused on improving the quality of life for elderly or disabled clients by providing person-centered care.
- The work involves assisting with **Activities of Daily Living**, such as personal hygiene, mobility, and meals, ensuring clients feel safe, comfortable, and respected.
- It requires strong communication and empathy to build trust, especially with clients who may have language barriers or conditions like dementia.
- It also involves teamwork, clear documentation, and following workplace policies to ensure safety and continuity of care, such as reporting changes in a client’s health.
- It's important to respect clients' autonomy, listen to their needs, and adapt care to their preferences, like offering favorite foods or adjusting routines.
- For me, being a support worker means making a real difference by helping clients maintain dignity and independence while creating a supportive and positive environment.

### What does person-centred care means to you?（*）

Person-centred care means **putting the client at the center of everything I do**.

- It's not only about physical support but also emotional and social well-being.
- It’s about respecting their choices to help them live with dignity and independence, while ensuring they feel safe, comfortable, and respected.
- It's important to respect clients' autonomy, listen to their needs, and adapt care to their preferences, like offering favorite foods or adjusting routines.
- As a support worker, I'll try to ensure the care is tailored and do things with them instead of doing things for them, encouraging them to participate as much as possible.
- In summary, Person-centred care is about creating a supportive and positive environment in clients’ lives while treating them as individuals.

1.  Can You Describe Your Approach To Personal Care Tasks?
My approach to personal care is respectful, gentle, and centered around the client’s comfort and dignity.
I always explain what I’m doing, seek consent, and encourage the client to participate as much as possible.
I ensure privacy by closing doors and using screens or towels during care.
I pay close attention to hygiene, skin integrity, and changes in health.
I use proper techniques for lifting or assisting to avoid injury.
Most importantly, I remain patient and supportive, adjusting my pace based on the client’s needs.
Personal care is more than a task—it’s a chance to build trust and connection.

### How do you build a good relationship with clients?

问题：你如何与客户建立良好的关系？

- I always treat clients with dignity, listening to their feelings and needs with a kind and patient attitude to make them feel valued.
- I use simple, friendly language and non-verbal cues like smiles or gestures, especially for clients with language barriers, to ensure they understand and feel comfortable.
- I take time to know their likes, dislikes, and background, such as asking about their favorite foods or hobbies, to personalize their care and build trust.
- I show up on time, follow their care plan, and keep promises, like preparing a meal they enjoy, so they know they can depend on me.
- I involve them in activities they love, like chatting about their favorite topics or helping with a hobby, to create positive, meaningful moments.
- I encourage their independence by offering choices, like asking if they prefer a shower now or later, showing I respect their decisions.
- I pay attention to their mood or health changes and adjust my approach, reporting concerns to my team to ensure their well-being.

For example, with a Chinese client, I might use my knowledge of their culture, like offering familiar dishes or greetings in Mandarin, to make them feel at home and strengthen our bond.

### How do you ensure clients’ safety?

Clients' safety is my highest priority. My approach is always based on the client's individualized support plan and following professional standards and procedures.

1. Physical and Environmental Safety: I try to prevent physical injury, especially falls.
   - I check the environment for any hazards that may cause harm, like wet floors, clutter, or loose rugs, to make sure the environment is safe.
   - I use the correct and safe techniques and required equipment when providing ambulation assistance. I ensure the client’s ability is respected so they do not become frustrated.

2. Clinical and Health Safety:
   - I follow the infection control procedures, such as hand hygiene and proper use of PPE. It also means ensuring client items are clean, like their laundry and linen.
   - I'm responsible for observing the client for any sudden changes, such as pain, fever, or changes in their mood or behavior. I manage medication reminders and communicate with the nurse about the client’s health status.
   - I ensure all assisted feeding and enteral feeding procedures are done safely and respect their dietary needs.

3. Dignity and Emotional Safety:
   - I ask for permission before providing care and respect their privacy.
   - If a client becomes distressed or aggressive, I try to understand the cause of their distress and redirect them to a safe activity.

### How do you ensure clients’ dignity?

Ensuring clients' dignity is the **highest priority**. This is the core requirement of **Aged Care Quality Standard 1**.

To me, dignity means treating clients as individuals and helping them maintain **control over their life**.

1. **Respecting Autonomy and Choice**: I ensure the client has **autonomy** by following the principles of **Person-Centred Care (PCC)**.
   - I ask for **permission** before providing care and respect their **privacy**.
   - I give simple **choices** whenever possible, for example: 'Would you like to have your shower now or in 30 minutes?' This helps them feel in control.

2. **Protecting Privacy**: I'm **conscientious** about protecting client's privacy, especially during personal care.
   - When assisting with personal hygiene, I ensure **close the door and pull the curtains** to give them privacy.
   - I make sure that their body is covered with a towel or gown as much as possible to protect their comfort and modesty.

3. **Valuing Identity and Culture**: Dignity is also about respecting who the person is. I ensure their **identity, culture, and diversity** are respected.
   - I never make assumptions about their needs. Instead, I check their care plan and ask open-ended questions about their preferences regarding their diet, religious practices, or if they prefer a male or female carer.
   - I always speak to them with a **calm** and **polite** tone, using their preferred name, to make them feel heard and valued.

当你到达史密斯太太家时，你会做哪些感染控制措施？（*）

**Infection control** is the practice to stop germs (like bacteria or viruses) from spreading to keep clients, support workers, and others safe — especially important in aged care, as older people are more at risk of getting sick. 

Infection control procedures are rules to follow this practice. 

- I would wash hands with soap and water or use alcohol-based sanitizer before and after client contact or touching surfaces. <!-- for at least 20 seconds -->
- I would use appropriate PPE, such as gloves, masks, or apron, and dispose of PPE properly after use.
  - For example, I would wear a mask if the client got sick.
  - I would wear shoe covers to avoid carrying germs from the outside.
- I would (regularly) clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces, equipment, and client areas to reduce the risk of infection spread.

<!-- If a client asks me to do something -->

1. The first thing I would do is to assess whether the task is outside my **Scope of Practice** (like providing medical treatments). This can be done by reviewing the client's care plan, the employer's policies, the support worker's qualifications, and my job description.
2. If the task is within my role, I would perform it while ensuring following the requirements and procedures, like wearing PPE.
3. If the task is outside my role, I would explain it to the client. I would suggest an appropriate solution within my role if possible, such as helping the client access the right support, like contacting a nurse or family member.
4. If I'm not sure whether should I perform the task, I would report it to my supervisor for advice.
5. I would document the request in the client's records.
6. I would continue to provide care within my role, ensuring the client feels supported and respected while their request is addressed appropriately.

### What support would you like your employer to provide to help you in your job?（*）

你希望你的雇主为你提供哪些支持来帮助你的工作？

- I hope for regular training, such as handling clients with complex health issues and using specialized tools.
- I hope for essential care tools, such as PPE, mobility aids, and basic medical supplies (like thermometers).
- I hope for safety measures, such as providing support for high-risk tasks (having a second staff member for client transfers).
- I hope for timely and detailed information, such as client care plans, schedule changes, and feedback from clients/families.
- I hope for supervisor support, so I can consult when facing tricky situations.
<!-- I hope for updates on industry standards (new infection control guidelines) to ensure my skills stay up-to-date. -->

### How to handle challenging situations?（*）

- Situation: During my placement, I experienced a challenging situation that I was assisting a client who was living with dementia to have a shower in the afternoon. When I began the task, the client became very agitated and showed strong resistance, pushing my hands away and shouting.

  3. <!-- 3. I offered simple choices to give him control — for example, “Would you like to wash your arms or legs first?”. -->
  4. I distracted him by turning on his favorite music and used gentle touch to comfort him.
  5. When he was too distressed, I stopped the care and report the incident to my supervisor.

- Result: The result was I successfully completed the essential parts of his care. From this experience I learned that using patience and flexibility is an effective way to care for people with dementia, and that safety is always built on a person-centred approach.

### Have you ever work with clients from different cultural backgrounds?（*）

- 你是否曾与来自不同文化背景的客户合作过？（你的文化背景除外）（*）
- 如何与不同文化背景的客户相处

I don’t have direct experience with clients from different culture backgrounds, but if I have a chance to work with them, I'll follow these steps.

- Before starting the care, I'll check the client’s care plan for cultural, language, or religious needs. If the plan is incomplete, I'll seek general knowledge about their preferences.
- I'll listen patiently and communicate effectively with the client. I'll never assume their needs based on their cultural backgrounds. I'll ask open-ended questions to encourage them to share their specific needs. For example, "How do you prefer to receive your personal care?"
- I'll use their feedback to adjust the care I deliver. This might mean modifying meal choices, ensuring privacy for prayer, or respecting their preference for a male or female carer.
- I'll document the client's specific needs and adaptations, and report it to my supervisor if I have any concerns. This ensures the whole team provides consistent and safe support.

### What would you do if a client refuses your service?（*）

- 客户拒绝服务/帮助
- 客户拒绝洗澡、吃饭或不配合护理
- 客户出现情绪低落、波动、抑郁等
- 应对来自客户的压力或者挑战

1. I would stay calm and respect the client’s right to make choices.
2. I would ask questions to find out why they’re refusing (which helps me address their concerns).
3. I would offer options. For instance, if they refuse to shower, I might say, “Would you like to freshen up with a washcloth instead, or maybe later today?” (This gives them control and reduces tension).
4. I would check the client’s care plan to find out how to handle refusals and follow workplace policies (ensuring I respect their autonomy while prioritizing their well-being).
5. If the refusal impacts their health or safety, I would document and report it to my supervisor, and maybe share with my team to keep everyone informed if necessary.
6. I would give them some time and check back later to see if they’re ready for service.

下面是一个使用 STAR 法则处理这种情况的例子。

- **Situation**: During my 120 hours of placement in an aged care facility, I was assigned to care for a client with dementia who became agitated and refused to eat during lunch.
- **Task**: My responsibility was to ensure the client’s well-being, including their nutrition, while maintaining their dignity and keeping the situation calm.
- **Action**: I stayed calm and spoke gently, saying, “I see you’re not hungry right now. Would you like something else to eat?” I noticed the client seemed overwhelmed by the busy dining room, so I offered to bring their meal to a quieter area. I also checked their care plan, which noted their favorite foods, and prepared a small portion of a dish they liked. I sat with them, talked about their favorite hobby to distract them, and encouraged them to eat slowly.
- **Result**: The client calmed down, ate a portion of their meal, and seemed more comfortable. My supervisor praised my patience and person-centered approach, and I documented the incident as per policy. This experience taught me how to handle challenging behaviors calmly and effectively.

12. What Would You Do If A Client Refuses Medication?
If a client refuses medication, I first try to understand the reason—whether it’s fear, confusion, side effects, or personal preference.
I speak to them calmly, explain the purpose of the medication, and offer reassurance.
If they still refuse, I respect their decision and document the refusal accurately.
I then report it to a nurse or supervisor so the situation can be monitored or reassessed.
Consistent refusals may require a review by a healthcare professional.
My approach balances respect for the client’s autonomy with the duty to protect their health and well-being.

### How would you handle confidential or sensitive information from a client?

- **Document and Report**: If a client shares information indicating potential harm, such as abuse or health concerns, I report it immediately to my supervisor
- **Build Trust with Clients**: I reassure clients that their information is safe with me, explaining how it will be used to support their care, which helps them feel secure and respected.

18. How Do You Maintain Confidentiality In Your Role?

Records are kept securely, whether written or digital, and I follow data protection regulations at all times.

6. **Follow Up**: I would check in with my supervisor to ensure the issue is being addressed and offer any further assistance needed to support the client’s well-being.

20. What Would You Do If You Suspected Abuse Or Neglect?
If I suspected abuse or neglect, I would stay calm, ensure the immediate safety of the client, and follow safeguarding procedures.
I would not confront the alleged abuser or promise confidentiality to the victim.
Instead, I would record the facts objectively—what I saw, heard, or was told—and report the concern to my designated safeguarding lead or manager without delay.
If the client was in immediate danger, I would contact emergency services.
Acting swiftly and responsibly is crucial to protecting vulnerable individuals.
I take every concern seriously and understand it is my duty to report, not to investigate.

### Activities of Daily Living, ADLs

Activities of Daily Living, or ADLs, are the essential tasks people need to do every day to take care of themselves and live independently. These include personal care tasks like Personal Hygiene, Dressing, Eating, Toileting, Mobility, and Continence care. As a support worker, my role is to assist clients with ADLs to maintain their comfort, dignity, and independence, especially if they have physical or cognitive limitations.

### Duty of Care

#### What is duty of care?

- Duty of care refers to a person’s obligation to their job.
- It relates to the responsibility to not cause harm or injury to others that could be reasonably foreseen.
- In aged care settings, this requires capable staff, safe premises, and quality clinical care. 

#### What is the relevance of duty of care in aged care?

- Duty of care lists what support workers should do.
- It describes the standards of reasonable and appropriate care. 
- It provides a legal basis for determining how to make the best decisions regarding aged care. 

In addition, duty of care is connected to the Charter of Aged Care Rights. Support workers must perform their obligations to ensure the clients enjoy their rights. 

#### Support workers' duty of care

Support workers' duty of care includes eight obligations, these are:

- Providing safe and high-quality service
- Treating people with dignity and respect
- Preventing abuse and neglect
- Protecting people's privacy
- Informing people about their care
- Helping people maintain independence
- Giving people control over their decisions
- Listening to people's opinions and feedback

### Dignity of Risk

#### What is dignity of risk?

- Dignity of risk means that older people can choose what they do and how they live. It means that these choices come with possible dangers.
- Support workers should respect their choices and accept the risks of these choices. 
- Support workers should respect clients' dignity by helping them carry out their choices despite the risks.
- Support workers and the care team should help minimise the risk involved with the person’s choices.

#### What is the support worker's duty of care in relation to dignity of risk?

- Support workers must ensure that the older person they are supporting is able to live their lives however they choose while maintaining their health and safety.
- It's support workers' duty to reduce the risks as much as possible.

#### Examples to reduce the risks

Support workers can develop ways to honour clients' dignity of risk while protecting their well-being, here are some ways to reduce the risks:

- Situation: A person wants to continue living alone despite their mobility issues.
- Result: They may hurt themselves without anyone there to help them.
- Suggestions:
  - Ask them to always keep an emergency cell phone with them. They can use it to call for help in case of emergencies.
  - Schedule more frequent check-ins and home visits.
  - Ask one of their neighbours to check in on them at least once a day.
  
- Situation: A person wants to continue using a cane instead of a wheelchair.
- Result: There is a greater risk of falling and injury when using a cane.
- Suggestions:
  - Ask them if they agree to have physical therapy to strengthen their arms and legs. This would make it safer for them to use a cane because they will be more stable.
  - Make sure they have a sturdy, stable, and comfortable cane to use.

- Situation: A person does not want to receive a flu vaccine.
- Result: They are at a higher risk of a serious flu infection.
- Suggestions:
  - Monitor their health more closely.
  - Minimise their potential exposure to the flu.

### Mandatory Reporting

#### What is Mandatory Reporting?

Mandatory reporting is the responsibility of reporting suspected instances of abuse. Professionals like teachers, medical workers and care workers all have this responsibility. When it comes to aged care, mandatory reporting enables older people to be protected from indicators and allegations of exploitation, abuse, harassment and neglect. 

As an aged care worker, you should know the mandatory reporting laws that apply to aged care. Familiarise yourself with the reporting policies and procedures of your workplace. This will help you protect the rights of the older people in your care.

The Aged Care Act 1997 defines a reportable incident as the occurrence, or suspected occurrence, of abuse, including: 

- Unreasonable use of force
- Unlawful sexual contact or inappropriate sexual conduct
- Psychological or emotional abuse
- Stealing done by an aged care worker
- Unexpected death of the residential care recipient
- Neglect
- Unreasonable use of restrictive practices
- Unexplained absence of the residential care recipient from the residential care services of the provider

Aged care workers must report these cases to the proper authorities. Aged care providers must respond to these reports quickly and efficiently. There must be a record of each report, including what was done to address it.

Mandatory reporting is related to your duty of care as an aged care worker. You must ensure that any reasonable belief of abuse to the older person you are supporting is reported to the proper authorities. 

If you have spotted any indicator of abuse or neglect in the older person, reach out immediately for help from authorities. Remember that mandatory reporting plays a vital role in preventing and stopping the harm that abuse, harassment and neglect can bring to older people.

### What is building good boundaries?

Building good boundaries means setting clear, respectful limits in my work with clients to stay professional, keep them safe, and protect their dignity, as per Australian aged care standards.

- **Respect Client Privacy**: I only discuss client details with authorized staff, like nurses, and avoid talking about their needs in public to protect their privacy.
- **Follow Role Limits**: I stick to my support worker tasks, like personal care or cleaning, and don’t do things outside my training, like giving medication, to stay safe.
- **Communicate Clearly**: I explain what I can do, like “I can help with your shower now,” and respect client choices to keep boundaries clear and professional.

6. How Do You Manage Personal Boundaries In Your Role?

### What do you know about manual handling in aged care?

问题：你对搬运技巧了解多少？

Manual handling in aged care is about safely moving or supporting clients, like helping them walk, sit, or get out of bed. It also includes moving objects, like lifting a chair or carrying supplies.

1. **Assess the Situation**: Before moving a client, I’d check their care plan for mobility needs or restrictions, like if they need a walker or have a recent injury. I’d also assess the environment for hazards, like clutter or wet floors, to ensure it’s safe.
2. **Communicate with the Client**: I’d explain what I’m doing to make them feel comfortable, saying, “I’m going to help you stand now – let me know if anything feels off.” I’d ask if they’re ready and encourage them to do as much as they can to maintain independence.
3. **Use Proper Techniques**: I’d use techniques from my training, like bending my knees, keeping my back straight, and holding the client close to my body for stability. For example, when helping someone stand, I’d support them under their arms, not pulling on their wrists.
4. **Use Equipment When Needed**: If a client needs more support, I’d use aids like hoists, slide sheets, or transfer belts, following the facility’s training. For instance, with a hoist, I’d check it’s in good condition and position it correctly before lifting.
5. **Work as a Team**: For complex transfers, like moving a client from bed to a wheelchair, I’d ask a colleague for help if the care plan requires two people. I’d coordinate by saying, “Let’s lift on three – ready?”
6. **Monitor and Adjust**: I’d watch for signs of discomfort during the task and stop if the client seems in pain. If something doesn’t work, I’d try a different approach or consult my supervisor. For example, if a client struggles to stand, I’d check if they need a different aid.
7. **Document and Report**: After assisting, I’d record any issues, like if the client felt unsteady, in their care notes. If I notice a new mobility concern, I’d report it to my supervisor to update the care plan.
8. **Follow Training and Policies**: I’d stick to the manual handling training from my Certificate III and the facility’s policies, which align with Australia’s Work Health and Safety regulations and Aged Care Standards. If I’m unsure, I’d ask for a refresher or guidance.

During my placement, I helped clients with tasks like transferring from bed to chair using a slide sheet or supporting them while walking with a walker. My steady personality helps me stay focused, and my habit of keeping spaces tidy ensures the environment is clear of trip hazards. I also prioritize the client’s dignity, making sure they feel secure and respected during any manual handling task.

What is Duty of Care?

The concept of Duty of Care is a foundational legal and ethical principle in Australian aged care and disability support, which mandates that a Support Worker must take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harm to the individual under their care.

Duty of Care is defined by three core obligations:

1. Legal Obligation to Prevent Harm

   This is the primary legal responsibility to ensure the client is safe and that services are provided competently and with skill.

   - Providing personal care and assistance with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in a safe and skilled manner.
   - Creating and maintaining a safe and supportive environment and monitoring the older person's health and wellbeing.
   - Promptly responding to any changes in a client's condition or concerns about matters that may impact the quality and safety of supports.

2. Ethical Obligation to Uphold Dignity and Choice

   In modern aged care, the Duty of Care is defined as providing a high standard of care that meets the person's assessed needs while upholding their rights, identity, and choices.

   - Treating the client with dignity and respect, and ensuring they live without abuse or neglect.
   - Respecting the individual’s right to self-determination and decision-making, and ensuring they are informed about their care in a way they understand.

3. Balancing Safety with Independence (Dignity of Risk)

   A critical component of the modern Duty of Care is supporting the individual’s Dignity of Risk. It is understood that empowering people to make informed choices is essential for maintaining independence and quality of life.

   - Allowing clients to have control over and make choices about their personal and social life, even when those choices involve a personal risk, provided that risk is calculated and the client is informed and understands the potential consequences.
   - Actively promoting independence and building the client's skills and confidence, rather than taking over tasks they can do for themselves. This ensures the support worker is reducing vulnerability by increasing independence, which is itself a safety measure.
   - When a safety concern arises regarding a client’s choice, the Support Worker's duty is to discuss the potential risks openly, document the client's informed decision, and work with the clinical team to identify alternative, safer ways for the client to achieve their goal, rather than simply removing their choice.

What is Dignity of Risk?

Dignity of Risk is a fundamental principle of Person-Centred Care in the Australian aged care and disability sectors. It is the ethical imperative to support a client’s right to make informed decisions and choices about their life and daily activities, even when those choices carry an element of calculated or potential risk, in order to maintain their independence and quality of life.

This principle is recognized as an integral component of the Support Worker’s Duty of Care. Modern practice dictates that empowering clients to make informed choices is the best way to maintain their safety, build confidence, and reduce vulnerability by increasing independence.

### Support Worker’s Approach to Dignity of Risk (Steps)

When a client expresses a preference or choice that involves a risk (e.g., wanting to walk unassisted despite a fall risk, or choosing a potentially unhealthy meal), the Support Worker must not arbitrarily remove that choice. Instead, you must follow a structured, ethical process:

1. Provide Timely and Tailored Information

   Your first responsibility is to ensure the client understands the situation and the potential consequences of their choice.[1]

   - Clearly and sensitively discuss the identified risks associated with their choice (e.g., "While I support you wanting to walk to the kitchen, the physiotherapist noted a high fall risk on this type of flooring. Are you aware of the potential for a fall?").
   - Provide information in a way the client can fully understand, allowing them time to process the information and ask questions.[1]

2. Respect and Document the Choice

   If the client, having been informed of the risk, still wishes to proceed, their choice must be respected to uphold their autonomy.

   - Document the client’s informed decision in their file or progress notes, noting that the risks were discussed and understood by the client.
   - This documentation is essential for quality and safety compliance and demonstrates that your organisation has supported the client to exercise their choice.

3. Implement Risk Mitigation and Collaborate

   The goal is to support the choice while actively reducing the chance of harm.

   - Work with the client to identify the *safest possible method* to execute their choice. For example, if they insist on walking, offer standby assistance or ensure appropriate aids (like a walker or transfer belt) are available and used correctly.
   - Promptly report the situation to your supervisor, the Registered Nurse, or the clinical team. This collaboration ensures the multidisciplinary team (e.g., Occupational Therapist, Physiotherapist) can be involved to identify alternative, safer support strategies that still allow the client to achieve their goal.[1]
   - Focus on building the client’s skills and confidence, rather than taking over the task, thereby promoting independence and reducing vulnerability.

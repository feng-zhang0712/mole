问题：你对以人为本的护理的理解是什么？

分析：The core value of care work。

Person-centred care is not only about physical support but also emotional and social wellbeing.

- I maybe involve their family when appropriate to understand their preferences better and provide holistic care.

Person-centred care is about making a positive difference in clients’ lives by treating them as individuals, not just tasks. For example, instead of just doing things for a client, I try to do things with them — encouraging them to participate as much as possible.

### Activities of Daily Living, ADLs

Activities of Daily Living, or ADLs, are the essential tasks people need to do every day to take care of themselves and live independently. These include personal care tasks like Personal Hygiene, Dressing, Eating, Toileting, Mobility, and Continence care. As a support worker, my role is to assist clients with ADLs to maintain their comfort, dignity, and independence, especially if they have physical or cognitive limitations.

Key points:

- **Person-Centred Approach**: I follow the client’s care plan and preferences, like helping them choose clothes or offering foods they enjoy.
- **Encourage Independence**: I support clients to do as much as they can themselves, e.g., guiding them to hold a spoon rather than feeding them, if possible.
- **Ensure Safety**: I use safe manual handling techniques, like supporting mobility with a walker, to prevent falls or injuries.
- **Communication**: For clients with communication difficulties, I use gestures or visual aids, like pointing to a towel for bathing, to assist with ADLs.
- **Document and Report**: I record how clients manage ADLs, noting any changes, like difficulty dressing, and report to my supervisor to update care plans.

Operational Details for Key ADLs:

- **Bathing/Showering**:
  - **Preparation**: Check the care plan for preferences (e.g., shower or sponge bath). Gather supplies like towels, soap, and non-slip mats.
  - **Procedure**: Ensure the bathroom is warm and safe. Assist with undressing while respecting privacy, using a towel to cover them if preferred. Use a shower chair for mobility issues, guide gently, and check water temperature. Offer choices, like “Do you want shampoo first?”
  - **Safety**: Use proper manual handling to prevent falls, like supporting their arm. Monitor for skin issues and report changes.
- **Dressing**:
  - **Preparation**: Lay out clothes the client prefers, as noted in the care plan, ensuring they’re clean and suitable for the weather.
  - **Procedure**: Assist with putting on clothes, starting with easier items like tops. Encourage independence, e.g., letting them button a shirt if able. For clients with dementia, use simple instructions like “Lift your arm.”
  - **Safety**: Ensure shoes are non-slip. Check for discomfort, like tight clothing, and adjust as needed.
- **Eating**:
  - **Preparation**: Confirm dietary needs (e.g., soft food, cultural preferences) from the care plan. Prepare meals I can cook, like simple home-cooked dishes, tailored to their taste.
  - **Procedure**: Assist with setting up, like cutting food or providing adaptive utensils. Encourage self-feeding if possible, or feed slowly, ensuring they chew safely. For Chinese clients, I might offer familiar dishes to make them comfortable.
  - **Safety**: Monitor for choking risks and ensure proper positioning (e.g., sitting upright). Document intake and report reduced appetite.
- **Toileting**:
  - **Preparation**: Check for continence aids (e.g., pads) and ensure the bathroom is accessible with grab rails.
  - **Procedure**: Assist with transferring to the toilet, using mobility aids if needed. Respect privacy by stepping out if safe. For clients with communication issues, use gestures to confirm needs.
  - **Safety**: Clean thoroughly to prevent infections, following hygiene protocols. Report changes in continence to the supervisor.
- **Mobility/Transferring**:
  - **Preparation**: Review the care plan for mobility aids (e.g., walker, hoist). Clear pathways to prevent tripping.
  - **Procedure**: Use proper manual handling techniques, like supporting under the arms, to assist with walking or transferring from bed to chair. Encourage small movements if possible.
  - **Safety**: My fitness and running experience help me stay strong for safe transfers. Check for pain or unsteadiness and report concerns.
- **General Practices**:
- **Person-Centred Care**: Respect client preferences, like timing or cultural needs (e.g., offering Chinese clients familiar routines), and involve them in decisions.
- **Communication**: Use simple language, gestures, or my Mandarin skills for non-English speakers to explain tasks clearly.
- **Hygiene and Safety**: Follow infection control protocols, like handwashing and using gloves, and ensure equipment is clean.
- **Documentation**: Record details in care notes, like “Client needed assistance with shower but ate independently,” and report changes to the team.

During my 120-hour placement, I assisted a client with limited mobility to shower using a chair, ensured their favorite clothes were ready for dressing, and used gestures to communicate meal choices, keeping them comfortable and safe.

### Infection control procedures

Infection control procedures are steps to stop the spread of germs, like viruses or bacteria, to keep clients, staff, and others safe in aged care settings.

- **Hand Hygiene**: Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before and after client contact, handling food, or toileting. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap isn’t available.
- **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**: Wear gloves, masks, or gowns as required, especially for tasks like toileting or wound care. Dispose of PPE properly after use.
- **Cleaning and Disinfection**: Clean high-touch surfaces like bedrails, doorknobs, or mobility aids with disinfectant daily or after use. Use single-use cloths or color-coded systems to avoid cross-contamination.
- **Equipment Hygiene**: Sterilize or disinfect reusable equipment, like hoists or utensils, according to workplace protocols. Store equipment in clean, dry areas.
- **Waste Management**: Dispose of soiled items, like continence pads, in sealed biohazard bags and follow workplace waste disposal guidelines.
- **Client Hygiene Support**: Assist clients with personal hygiene, like bathing or oral care, using clean supplies and following their care plan to reduce infection risks.
- **Food Safety**: Prepare and store food safely, ensuring proper temperatures and hygiene. Use my cooking skills to make safe, culturally appropriate meals, like for Chinese clients.
- **Monitor and Report**: Observe clients for signs of infection, like fever or redness, and report immediately to my supervisor. Document incidents in care notes.
- **Follow Protocols**: Adhere to Australia’s Aged Care Quality Standards and workplace infection control policies, including isolation procedures if a client has an infectious condition.
- **Personal Health**: Stay healthy, avoid working when sick, and keep vaccinations up to date to protect clients.

### What is Duty of Care?

Duty of care means I have a responsibility to keep clients safe and healthy while providing care, ensuring I do no harm, as required by Australian aged care laws.

- **Follow Care Plans**: I check and follow each client’s care plan to meet their needs, like mobility or health support, to keep them safe and comfortable.
- **Act Safely**: I use proper techniques, like safe manual handling or infection control, to prevent injuries or illness, following my Certificate III training.
- **Watch and Report:** I notice any risks or changes, like pain or confusion, and tell my supervisor right away to protect the client.
- **Respect and Dignity**: I treat clients with kindness and respect, protecting their privacy and choices, to meet Aged Care Quality Standards.

### What is building good boundaries?

Building good boundaries means setting clear, respectful limits in my work with clients to stay professional, keep them safe, and protect their dignity, as per Australian aged care standards.

- **Stay Professional**: I keep a friendly but not personal relationship, avoiding sharing my own problems or getting too close, to maintain trust and focus on care.
- **Respect Client Privacy**: I only discuss client details with authorized staff, like nurses, and avoid talking about their needs in public to protect their privacy.
- **Follow Role Limits**: I stick to my support worker tasks, like personal care or cleaning, and don’t do things outside my training, like giving medication, to stay safe.
- **Communicate Clearly**: I explain what I can do, like “I can help with your shower now,” and respect client choices to keep boundaries clear and professional.

### What do you know about manual handling in aged care?

问题：你对搬运技巧了解多少？

Manual handling in aged care is about safely moving or supporting clients, like helping them walk, sit, or get out of bed. It also includes moving objects, like lifting a chair or carrying supplies.

1. **Assess the Situation**: Before moving a client, I’d check their care plan for mobility needs or restrictions, like if they need a walker or have a recent injury. I’d also assess the environment for hazards, like clutter or wet floors, to ensure it’s safe.
2. **Communicate with the Client**: I’d explain what I’m doing to make them feel comfortable, saying, “I’m going to help you stand now – let me know if anything feels off.” I’d ask if they’re ready and encourage them to do as much as they can to maintain independence.
3. **Use Proper Techniques**: I’d use techniques from my training, like bending my knees, keeping my back straight, and holding the client close to my body for stability. For example, when helping someone stand, I’d support them under their arms, not pulling on their wrists.
4. **Use Equipment When Needed**: If a client needs more support, I’d use aids like hoists, slide sheets, or transfer belts, following the facility’s training. For instance, with a hoist, I’d check it’s in good condition and position it correctly before lifting.
5. **Work as a Team**: For complex transfers, like moving a client from bed to a wheelchair, I’d ask a colleague for help if the care plan requires two people. I’d coordinate by saying, “Let’s lift on three – ready?”
6. **Monitor and Adjust**: I’d watch for signs of discomfort during the task and stop if the client seems in pain. If something doesn’t work, I’d try a different approach or consult my supervisor. For example, if a client struggles to stand, I’d check if they need a different aid.
7. **Document and Report**: After assisting, I’d record any issues, like if the client felt unsteady, in their care notes. If I notice a new mobility concern, I’d report it to my supervisor to update the care plan.
8. **Follow Training and Policies**: I’d stick to the manual handling training from my Certificate III and the facility’s policies, which align with Australia’s Work Health and Safety regulations and Aged Care Standards. If I’m unsure, I’d ask for a refresher or guidance.

During my placement, I helped clients with tasks like transferring from bed to chair using a slide sheet or supporting them while walking with a walker. My steady personality helps me stay focused, and my habit of keeping spaces tidy ensures the environment is clear of trip hazards. I also prioritize the client’s dignity, making sure they feel secure and respected during any manual handling task.

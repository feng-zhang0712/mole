### Why choose this job

- 这个职位最吸引你的是什么
- 你为什么想在社区老年护理或社区残疾人服务领域从事个人护理员（PCW）的职业

- I previously worked in the internet industry as a software engineer, but the work environment can be tough for someone over 35, especially with the development of Artificial Intelligence.
- I have almost spent every day facing the computer screen for the past 10 years, I realized, especially in recent years, that as I get older, I don't want to just talk to the cold machines, I want to do something more meaningful.
- I believe 35 is the prime of my life, not the end of my career, it can be a new beginning.
- This role aligns with my goal of making a contribution in a country I love, because Australia has always been my dream destination to work and live.
- This role offers a stable work environment and opportunity for both personal and professional growth, which is important for my long-term career goals.

- For the next few years, I want to get a Certificate IV in individual support and diploma, take on more responsibilities, maybe as a senior support worker or team leader.
- For the long term, I want to stay in aged care for a long career, maybe as a manager.

### What do you learned from previous job.

- Attention to Detail: In programming, one small mistake in the code can crash the whole system, so I developed a habit of being careful and double-checking in every task, whether it’s reviewing the client's individualized care plan, or writing accurate records.
- Patience: Programming requires a lot of patience to fix problems. I learned to stay calm under pressure and not give up easily. I bring this same patience to my clients, especially when supporting those with dementia or communication barriers who need extra time to express themselves.
- Teamwork: I previously worked as part of a big team, there were project manager, designers, testers, clients, and other software engineers. This taught me to listen carefully and communicate effectively with others, these are important skills that are essential when working within a multidisciplinary team as a support worker, cause aged care is a team-based work.
- Continuous Learning: Technology changes fast in the IT industry, so I developed a habit of ongoing learning. As a support worker, I'll keep learning in the aged care industry, aiming to provide better service for my clients and contributing to the team and even the whole industry in the long run.

### How do you pre colleagues describe you?

- I am known as someone who is easy to get along with. I am always happy to help a colleague if they are busy or struggling. I don't just focus on my own work; I care about the whole team's success.
- I am punctual (on time) and I never leave a task unfinished. In my previous team, if I promised to do something, I always did it. I know that in Aged Care, reliability is crucial because the residents and the team depend on me showing up on time.
- My colleagues often mentioned that I stay very calm under pressure. When we had technical problems or tight deadlines, I didn't panic. I just focused on solving the problem. I believe this will help me when dealing with busy shifts or challenging behaviors in Aged Care.

### How do you think of aged care or support worker?

- I see aged care and support work as a deeply meaningful role focused on improving the quality of life for elderly or disabled clients by providing person-centered care.
- The work involves assisting with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), such as personal hygiene, mobility, and meals, ensuring clients feel safe, comfortable, and respected.
- It requires strong communication and empathy to build trust, especially with clients who may have language barriers or conditions like dementia.
- It's important to respect clients' autonomy, listen to their needs, and adapt care to their preferences, like offering favorite foods or adjusting routines.
- It also involves teamwork, clear documentation, and following workplace policies to ensure safety and continuity of care, such as reporting changes in a client’s health.
- For me, being a support worker means making a real difference by helping clients maintain dignity and independence while creating a supportive and positive environment.

### How do you manage stress in this role?

- Being a support worker can be physically and emotionally challenging, and managing stress is essential to provide better service for clients.
- I recognize stressful situations to prepare myself, such as busy shifts or clients' complex needs.
- I use care plans and schedules to prioritize tasks, breaking them into manageable steps to reduce overwhelm and ensure all clients receive timely support.
- During a shift, if I feel overwhelmed, I stop and take a deep breath or maybe step away for one minute to calm down.
- After a shift, I reflect on what went well and what could improve, using feedback to build confidence and reduce stress in the future.
- I discuss challenging situations with my supervisor or colleagues for advice or share responsibilities.
- During my daily routine, I maintain physical and emotional health through regular exercise, healthy eating, and rest.

### What does person-centred care means to you?

Person-centred care means putting the client at the centre of everything we do.

- It's not only about physical support but also emotional and social well-being.
- It's about treating them as unique individuals, not just a list of medical conditions.
- It’s about respecting their choices to help them live with dignity and independence, while ensuring they feel safe, comfortable, and respected.
- As a support worker, I'll try to ensure the care is tailored and do things with them instead of doing things for them, encouraging them to participate as much as possible.

### Support I hope from the employer

- I hope for regular training, such as handling clients with complex health issues and using specialized tools.
- I hope for essential care tools, such as PPE, mobility aids, and basic medical supplies (like thermometers).
- I hope for safety measures, such as providing support for high-risk tasks (having a second staff member for client transfers).
- I hope for timely and detailed information, such as client care plans, schedule changes, and feedback from clients/families.
- I hope for supervisor support, so I can consult when facing tricky situations.

### What shifts are you available for?

I'm available for both weekday and weekend shifts. I'm also available in the morning, afternoon, and evening, depending on the team's schedules.

### What do you hope to learn from this job if you are hired?

- I hope to build my skills in personal care, dementia support, and responding to changes in clients’ physical and emotional needs.
- I want to learn from experienced colleagues how to communicate effectively with clients, families, and multidisciplinary teams.

## 场景题

### What would you do if there's no response after you arrived client's house?

1. First, I'd not force the door open or break in.
2. I'd check if I have the right address and time from the schedule.
3. I'd knock the door a few more times, call the client’s mobile, and leave a short message to ask if the client is okay.
4. I'd call the client’s emergency contact or ask the neighbors for help.
5. I'd check the environment for any unusual signs, like lights or sounds, and call 000 for emergency services if necessary.
6. If I still get no response from the client, I'd document and report it to my supervisor, and I'll stay until I get clear instructions.

### Infection Control

- 到达客户家时采取的防传染措施
- 给老人洗澡应注意哪些防传染措施

Infection control is the practices and procedures used to prevent the spread of infections between clients, support workers, families, and the community. In aged care and disability support, many clients have weaker immune systems, so infection control is essential to protect their safety, health, and wellbeing. Infection control is part of a support worker’s duty of care and professional responsibility.

- I'd wash hands with soap and water or use alcohol-based sanitizer before and after the care, client contact, or touching surfaces.
- I'd use appropriate PPE, such as gloves, masks, and apron, and dispose of PPE properly after use.
  - For instance, I'd wear a mask if the client get sick.
  - I'd wear shoe covers to avoid carrying germs from the outside.
- I'd (regularly) clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces, client areas, and equipment to reduce the risk of infection spread.
- I'd observe the client for signs of infection (fever, cough, or red skin), and document and report it to my supervisor immediately.
- I'd avoid touching my eyes, nose, or mouth during the service period.
- During my daily routine, I'd stay healthy, avoid working when sick, and keep vaccinations up to date.

### What would you do in an emergency situation?

1. The first thing I'd do is stay calm.
2. I'd check the environment, remove any hazards that may cause further harm, to ensure both the client and I are safe.
3. I'd avoid moving the client directly unless it’s unsafe to stay (like in a fire).
4. I'd apply basic first aid and follow the DRSABCD action plan if appropriate.
5. If the situation is serious, like the client is unconscious or has a suspected heart attack, I'd call 000 for emergency services immediately. If the situation is under control and the client is able and safe to move, I'd help them stand up, using proper manual handling techniques (like supporting their arm or using a transfer belt). <!-- 如果客户摔倒且身体状况良好，再补充前面这句话 -->
6. I'd keep the client comfortable and offer reassurance by talking to them to reduce their anxiety.
7. I'd keep monitoring to prevent the client's condition from getting worse until the emergency services arrived.
8. I'd document and report the incident to my supervisor and share with my team to keep the authorized colleagues informed to prevent this kind of incident in the future if necessary.

### What would you do if the client ask you to do something?

- 史密斯太太要求你清洁吊扇。你会怎么做
- 如果客户要求你做一些超出你职责范围的事情，你会怎么做

1. The first thing I'd do is to assess whether the task is within my Scope of Practice (like providing medical treatments). This can be done by reviewing the client's individualised support plan, my job description, and the employer's policies.
2. If the task is within my role, I'd perform it while ensuring following the requirements and procedures, like wearing PPE.
3. If the task is outside my role, I'd explain it to the client. I'd suggest an appropriate solution within my role if possible, such as helping the client access the right support, like contacting a nurse or family member.
4. If I'm not sure whether should I perform the task, I'd report it to my supervisor for advice.
5. I'd document the request in the client's progress notes, review and discuss with my team later to update the support plan with the client's consent, ensuring the client feels supported and respected while their request is addressed appropriately.

### Handle Refusal

1. I'd stay calm and respect the client’s right to make choices.
2. I'd ask gentle questions to find out why they’re refusing, sometimes refusal means something wrong with their physical or mental health, or even the care we provided.
3. I'd explain the purpose of the support and the potential risks of their refusal.
4. I'd check the client’s care plan to find out how to handle refusals.
5. I'd offer options to give them control and reduce tension. For instance, if they refuse to shower, I might say, “Would you like to freshen up with a washcloth instead, or maybe later today?”.
6. I'd give them some time then check back later, or when they feel relaxed or in a good mood, ask them again if they’re ready for service.
7. If the refusal impacts their safety or health, I'd document and report it to my supervisor, and maybe share with my team to keep the authorized colleagues informed if necessary.

### Handle Challenging Situations

- Situation: During my placement, I experienced a challenging situation that I was assisting a client who was living with dementia to have a shower in the afternoon. During the task, the client became very agitated and showed strong resistance, pushing my hands away.
- Task: My task was to ensure the client's safety and dignity, and find a way to complete the care without making the situation worse.
- Action: I followed these steps to manage the situation:

  1. I explained each step before I did it.
  2. When the client became agitated, I stopped the care and stepped back to give him some space.
  3. I tried to find out the reason for the challenge. I realized the water might have been cold, or maybe I moved my hands too quickly, so I adjusted the water temperature and used gentle touch to comfort him, and distracted him by turning on his favorite music.
  4. After finishing the care, I covered him with a dry, warm towel to maintain his dignity and reported the incident to my supervisor.

- Result: The result was I successfully completed the care. From this experience, I learned that using patience and flexibility is an effective way to care for people with dementia, and safety is always built on a person-centred approach.

### Work with clients from different cultural backgrounds

I don’t have direct experience with clients from different culture backgrounds, but if I have a chance to work with them, I'll follow these steps.

- Before starting the care, I'll check the client’s care plan for cultural, language, or religious needs. If the plan is incomplete, I'll seek general knowledge about their preferences.
- During the care, I'll listen patiently and communicate effectively with the client. I'll never assume their needs based on their cultural backgrounds. I'll ask open-ended questions to encourage them to share their specific needs. For example, "How do you prefer to receive your personal care?"
- I'll use their feedback to adjust the care I delivered. This might mean modifying meal choices, ensuring privacy for prayer, or respecting their preference for a male or female carer.
- I'll document the client's specific needs and adaptations, and report it to my supervisor if I have any concerns. This ensures the whole team provides consistent and safe support.

### Handle multiple clients in one busy shift

- I start by reviewing the clients' care plans, identify and prioritize urgent and high-risk tasks. For instance, tasks like managing medical needs or addressing immediate health concerns take top priority to prevent risks.
- Then I focus on tasks with fixed schedules, like medication or meal times, to maintain clients’ expectations.
- I check in with each client to understand their immediate needs or preferences. This helps me adjust priorities if someone needs urgent attention.
- I remain flexible in case unexpected situations arise, such as a client feeling unwell, and re-prioritize tasks as needed while keeping all clients’ needs in mind.
- I keep clients informed about what you are doing and expected timeframes, and communicate with supervisors or team members if workload becomes unsafe.
- I accurately document care provided and promptly report any changes in clients’ conditions or incidents according to workplace procedures.
- Stay calm, focused, and respectful under pressure to ensure safe, consistent, and person-centred care for all clients.

### When the client is impatient on seeing a doctor

- 看病、外出就餐时等待很久，客人不耐烦怎么办
- 周边环境嘈杂怎么办

- I stay calm.
- I ensure immediate safety — find a seat, remove hazards, fasten seatbelt or help them sit if needed.
- I acknowledge their feeling, explain briefly and simply what’s happening.
<!-- - Offer two simple choices (gives control): e.g. “Would you like to wait in the waiting room or sit in the car for a few minutes?” -->
- I distracted the client by chatting with them.
- If at a clinic, let staff know the client is anxious, so they may be able to prioritize or fast-track.
- If impatience risks safety (agitation, trying to leave into traffic), move to a safer place and seek help from clinic staff or call your supervisor.
- After the visit, document the incident and inform your supervisor/family if relevant; update the care plan with strategies that helped.
- Preventive steps for next time: allow extra travel/appointment time, give regular time warnings (“we leave in 10 minutes”), schedule quieter appointment times, bring a familiar object or activity.

### Handle conflict

As a Support Worker, I think there are two kinds of conflicts: conflict with clients or their families and conflict with colleagues. I'll give two examples of how I handle these two different situations.

- I’d keep my tone gentle and my body language relaxed, even if the person is upset. Taking a deep breath helps me respond thoughtfully rather than react emotionally. My steady personality supports this approach.
- I’d give them full attention, letting them explain their concern without interrupting. For example, I’d say, “I’m sorry you’re upset about this. Please tell me more so I can understand.” This shows respect and often helps de-escalate the situation.
- I’d validate their emotions, saying something like, “I can see why that would be frustrating for you.” This demonstrates empathy without necessarily agreeing with their view.
- I’d ask open-ended questions to get clear details, such as, “Can you help me understand what happened during the meal preparation?” If it’s about food, for instance, I’d note their preferences and offer to adjust, using my skills to cook something they like better.
- If I can address it directly, I’d suggest practical options while respecting the client’s choices. For example, if a family member disagrees with the care routine, I’d explain the care plan gently and say, “We can adjust this to better suit your loved one – what would work best?”
- If the conflict is beyond my scope or remains unresolved, I’d involve my supervisor calmly, saying, “I want to make sure this is handled properly, so I’ll speak with my manager and get back to you soon.” I’d never argue or make promises I can’t keep.
- I’d record the concern in the progression notes factually, noting what was said, actions taken, and any follow-up, like, “Family member expressed dissatisfaction with meal; discussed preferences, referred to supervisor.”
- Afterward, I’d check back with the client or family to ensure they feel heard and the issue is resolved, reinforcing trust.

### Manager personal boundaries with clients

- The first and most important principle is to keep a clear professional relationship, not a personal or dependent one, while still being respectful, kind, and supportive.
- I avoid becoming personally or emotionally over-involved with clients.
- I only perform tasks that are within the client’s individualized support plan and my scope of practice.
- Be friendly, polite, and empathetic, but avoid sharing personal problems, opinions, or private information.
- I provide personal care in a dignified way, explain actions before touching, and respond to emotional needs without encouraging dependency.
- I politely but firmly say no to inappropriate requests, gifts, or favours, and explain the reason in a professional manner.
- I discuss boundary issues with my supervisor early and document and report any concerns to protect both the client and myself.
<!-- - Adhere to workplace policies, the Aged Care Code of Conduct, and professional standards at all times. -->

### When notice signs of abuse or neglect

- I'd stay calm, make sure the client is safe. If there’s immediate danger, I'd take appropriate action, removing the client from harm.
- I'd carefully observe any physical, emotional, or behavioral signs of abuse or neglect, ensuring I have clear and accurate details without jumping to conclusions.
- I'd document and report the incident to my supervisor immediately. I’d provide factual details about what I observed without making assumptions, focusing on the co-worker’s actions and the client’s well-being.
- If the situation involves serious abuse or neglect, I know aged care workers in Australia are required to report it under the Aged Care Act. I’d follow the Mandatory Reporting process, report it to the appropriate authorities, like Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission.
- I'd offer emotional support to the client, listening to their concerns and ensuring they feel safe and respected.
- I'd check in with my supervisor to ensure the issue is being addressed and offer any further assistance needed to support the client’s well-being.

### Ensure clear communication with clients who have communication difficulties

- 确保与有沟通障碍的客户进行清晰的沟通
- 如何照顾一个不会说英文（not speak English）的老人
- 如何与帕金森（dementia）或者听力障碍（hearing difficulties）的人沟通

- I review the client’s care plan to understand their specific communication challenges, such as dementia or speech difficulties.
- I speak slowly and clearly, using short and simple sentences to make it easy for clients to understand.
- I use body language, facial expressions, eye contact to support clients with hearing loss or cognitive challenges.
- I use pictures, notes, or communication boards to support clients with speech or hearing difficulties.
- I give clients time to respond and reduce stress.
- I ask yes/no or observe clients reactions to ensure they understand.
- I may ask my supervisor for advice, consult family for preferences, or use interpreters for non-English and Mandarin speakers if needed.
- I document effective methods and report changes in care notes, ensuring the team is informed.

### Handle client's complaint or feedback

- I stay calm and listen carefully about the client's concerns without interrupting and show empathy, so they feel heard and respected.
- I acknowledge their feelings and apologize, then clarify the problem by asking gentle questions to make sure I fully understand their concern.
- I take immediate steps to resolve it if possible, while ensuring aligning with the client’s individualised support plan and following workplace policies.
- If the complaint is complex or beyond my scope of practice, I document and report it to my supervisor.
- I check with the client later to ensure they’re satisfied with the resolution.
- Actually, complaints and feedback are important, cause they help me improve the care and prevent similar issues in the future.

### Handle client's confidential or sensitive information

For me, protecting client’s confidential or sensitive information is important for providing safe and professional care. I follow all workplace policies, the Privacy Act, and the organisation’s confidentiality rules.

- I treat all client information as confidential.
- If a client tells me personal or sensitive information, I listen respectfully and keep it private.
- I only share client information with authorized personnel on a need-to-know basis, and I never discuss them in public areas.
- I make sure all documents and notes are handled properly, for example, keeping care records secure, logging out of computer systems, and not leaving paperwork unattended.
- I’m always mindful of privacy in the physical environment, speaking quietly, not discussing clients in public areas, and making sure conversations happen in private spaces.
- If the information impacts clients' safety and health, such as abuse or health concerns, I document and report it to my supervisor.
- Overall, confidentiality means respecting the client, protecting their dignity, and ensuring their information is always safe and used only for their care.

### Work as part of a team

- I share information accurately during handovers, listen to others’ input, and speak up promptly about client needs or safety concerns.
- I work within my scope of practice, respect the responsibilities of nurses, coordinators, and other support workers, and avoid role overlap.
- I arrive on time, complete assigned tasks, and follow through on commitments so the team can rely on me.
- I offer help when appropriate, be flexible during busy shifts, and contribute to a positive and professional team environment.
- I work consistently according to organizational guidelines to ensure safe, coordinated, and high-quality care.
- Be open to feedback, reflect on my practice, and use supervision and training to continuously improve teamwork and care quality.

### Ensure clients’ safety

Clients' safety is my highest priority. My approach is always based on the client's individualized support plan and following professional standards and procedures.

- For physical and environmental safety, I try to prevent physical injury, especially falls. I regularly check the environment for any hazards that may cause harm, like wet floors, clutter, or loose rugs, to make sure the environment is safe. I use the correct and safe techniques and equipment when providing ambulation assistance.
- For clinical and health safety, I follow the infection control procedures to ensure the client's safety and health. I manage medication reminders and communicate with the nurse about the client’s health status.
- For dignity and emotional safety, I ask for permission before providing care and respect their privacy. If a client becomes distressed or aggressive, I try to understand the cause of their distress and redirect them to a safe activity.
- I document and report things like incidents, safety concerns, or changes in clients' condition to the nurse or my supervisor. This ensures the whole team to provide safe and consistent care.

### Ensure clients’ dignity

Ensuring clients' dignity is the highest priority. This is the core requirement of Aged Care Quality Standard. To me, dignity means treating clients as individuals and helping them maintain control over their life.

- To respect autonomy and choice, I ensure the client has autonomy by following the principles of Person-Centred Care (PCC). I ask for permission before providing care and respect their privacy. I give simple choices whenever possible, for example: 'Would you like to have your shower now or in 30 minutes?' This helps them feel in control.
- To protect privacy, I'm conscientious about protecting client's privacy, especially during personal care. When assisting with personal hygiene, I ensure close the door and pull the curtains to give them privacy. I make sure that their body is covered with a towel or gown as much as possible to protect their comfort and modesty.
- To value identity and culture, Dignity is also about respecting who the person is. I ensure their identity, culture, and diversity are respected. I never make assumptions about their needs. Instead, I check their care plan and ask open-ended questions about their preferences regarding their diet, religious practices, or if they prefer a male or female carer. I always speak to them with a calm and polite tone, using their preferred name, to make them feel heard and valued.

By focusing on these steps, I ensure that the client is safe, respected, and treated with the dignity they deserve.

## 专业题

### Activities of Daily Living, ADLs

Activities of Daily Living, or ADLs, are the essential tasks people need to do every day to take care of themselves and live independently. These include personal care tasks like Personal Hygiene, Dressing, Eating, Toileting, Mobility, and Continence care. As a support worker, my role is to assist clients with ADLs to maintain their comfort, dignity, and independence, especially if they have physical or cognitive limitations.

### Duty of care

Duty of care is our most important legal and ethical responsibility as a Support Worker. It means we have an obligation to take reasonable action to ensure the clients' safety, health, and well-being, and to protect them from harm that could be reasonably foreseen.

### Dignity of Risk

Dignity of risk means respecting client's right to make choices, even if these choices involve possible risks.

### Individualised Support Plan

### Mandatory Reporting

Mandatory reporting is a legal requirement to report suspected or observed abuse, neglect, or exploitation of vulnerable people, including children and older adults, to the appropriate authorities.

Support worker’s duty of care is to promptly identify and report any signs of abuse or neglect according to organizational policies and legal requirements, ensuring the client’s safety while maintaining confidentiality and professionalism.

### Manual Handling

### What's the difference between Home Care and Residential Aged Cared?

The main difference between Home Care and Residential Aged Care is where the care is provided and how much support the client needs.

**Home Care**

- Home care supports clients in their own homes, helping them stay independent as long as possible. Clients usually have lower to moderate care needs. 
- Support workers usually support one client at a time based on the client’s individualized support plan.
- As a support worker, tasks often include:
  - ADLs, such as personal hygiene, mobility and meal preparation
  - Transport to appointments
  - Housework
  - Social support and companionship

**Residential Aged Care** / **Nursing Home Care**

- Residential aged care is provided in a facility (like nursing home), for people with higher or complex health conditions or care needs who can no longer live independently by themselves.
- Support workers often work as part of a larger team, supporting multiple clients during a shift and following care plans and safety procedures.
- As a support worker, tasks often include:
  - 24/7 supervision
  - Assistance with most ADLs
  - Work closely within a multidisciplinary team (like clinical care from nurses)

**Summary**

In short, home care focuses on independence and support in the client’s own home, while residential aged care focuses on higher-level, continuous care in a facility. In both settings, the goal is the same: to ensure safety, health, and wellbeing through person-centred care.

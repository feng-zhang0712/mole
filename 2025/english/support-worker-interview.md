### Why choose this job

- 这个职位最吸引你的是什么
- 你为什么想在社区老年护理或社区残疾人服务领域从事个人护理员（PCW）的职业

- I previously worked in the internet industry as a software engineer, but the work environment can be tough for someone over 35, especially with the development of Artificial Intelligence.
- I have almost spent every day facing the computer screen for the past 10 years, I realized, especially in recent years, that as I get older, I don't want to just talk to the cold machines, I want to do something more meaningful.
- I believe 35 is the prime of my life, not the end of my career, it can be a new beginning.
- This role aligns with my goal of making a contribution in a country I love, because Australia has always been my dream destination to work and live.
- This role offers a stable work environment and opportunity for both personal and professional growth, which is important for my long-term career goals.
- I think the most valuable thing is helping others, especially those who need support to live with dignity and independence, being a support worker allows me to make a real difference in people’s lives, giving me a sense of purpose and fulfillment.

### Future plans

- In the short term, I want to gain more experience to better serve my clients, like handling clients with complex health issues.
- For the next few years, I want to get a Certificate IV in individual support and diploma, take on more responsibilities, maybe as a senior support worker or team leader.
- For the long term, I want to stay in aged care for a long career, maybe as a manager.

### What do you learned from previous job.

From my previous job, I learned three key skills that make me a better Support Worker.

- **Attention to Detail**: In programming, one small mistake in the code can crash the whole system. I developed a habit of being **careful and double-checking**. In Aged Care, this is very important for reviewing clients' Care Plans, checking dietary requirements, and writing accurate records. I never guess; I always check.
- **Patience and Problem Solving**: Programming requires a lot of patience to fix problems. I learned to stay calm under pressure and not give up easily. This helps me in Aged Care. For example, if a client with dementia is confused or upset, I have the patience to listen, wait, and find a gentle way to help them.
- **Teamwork and Communication**: In my previous job, I worked in a big team where clear communication was essential to finish projects. I know that Aged Care is also **team-based work**. I am good at following instructions, reporting issues to supervisors, and working smoothly with nurses and other carers.

### How do you pre colleagues describe you?

- I am known as someone who is easy to get along with. I am always happy to help a colleague if they are busy or struggling. I don't just focus on my own work; I care about the whole team's success.
- I am punctual (on time) and I never leave a task unfinished. In my previous team, if I promised to do something, I always did it. I know that in Aged Care, reliability is crucial because the residents and the team depend on me showing up on time.
- My colleagues often mentioned that I stay very calm under pressure. When we had technical problems or tight deadlines, I didn't panic. I just focused on solving the problem. I believe this will help me when dealing with busy shifts or challenging behaviors in Aged Care.

### What shifts are you available for?

I'm available for both weekday and weekend shifts. I'm also available in the morning, afternoon, and evening, depending on the team's schedules.

### How do you think of aged care or support worker?

- I see aged care and support work as a deeply meaningful role focused on improving the quality of life for elderly or disabled clients by providing person-centered care.
- The work involves assisting with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), such as personal hygiene, mobility, and meals, ensuring clients feel safe, comfortable, and respected.
- It requires strong communication and empathy to build trust, especially with clients who may have language barriers or conditions like dementia.
- It's important to respect clients' autonomy, listen to their needs, and adapt care to their preferences, like offering favorite foods or adjusting routines.
- It also involves teamwork, clear documentation, and following workplace policies to ensure safety and continuity of care, such as reporting changes in a client’s health.
- For me, being a support worker means making a real difference by helping clients maintain dignity and independence while creating a supportive and positive environment.

### How do you manage stress in this role?

- Being a support worker can be physically and emotionally challenging, and managing stress is essential to provide better service for clients.
- I recognize stressful situations to prepare myself, such as busy shifts or clients' complex needs.
- I use care plans and schedules to prioritize tasks, breaking them into manageable steps to reduce overwhelm and ensure all clients receive timely support.
- During a shift, if I feel overwhelmed, I stop and take a deep breath or maybe step away for one minute to calm down.
- After a shift, I reflect on what went well and what could improve, using feedback to build confidence and reduce stress in the future.
- I discuss challenging situations with my supervisor or colleagues for advice or share responsibilities.
- During my daily routine, I maintain physical and emotional health through regular exercise, healthy eating, and rest.

### What does person-centred care means to you?

Person-centred care means putting the client at the centre of everything we do.

- It's not only about physical support but also emotional and social well-being.
- It's about treating them as unique individuals, not just a list of medical conditions.
- It’s about respecting their choices to help them live with dignity and independence, while ensuring they feel safe, comfortable, and respected.
- As a support worker, I'll try to ensure the care is tailored and do things with them instead of doing things for them, encouraging them to participate as much as possible.

## 场景题

### What would you do if there's no response after you arrived client's house?

1. First, I'd not force the door open or break in.
2. I'd check if I have the right address and time from the schedule.
3. I'd knock the door a few more times, call the client’s mobile, and leave a short message to ask if the client is okay.
4. I'd call the client’s emergency contact or ask the neighbors for help.
5. I'd check the environment for any unusual signs, like lights or sounds, and call 000 for emergency services if necessary.
6. If I still get no response from the client, I'd document and report it to my supervisor, and I'll stay until I get clear instructions.

### Infection Control and Measures will you take when you arrive at client's house?

Infection control means the actions and practices used to prevent the spread of infections between clients, workers, families, and the community. In aged care and disability support, many clients have weaker immune systems, so infection control is essential to protect their safety, health, and wellbeing. Infection control is part of a support worker’s duty of care and professional responsibility.

Infection control procedures are the rules and standard steps that workers follow to reduce infection risks.

- I'd wash hands with soap and water or use alcohol-based sanitizer before and after the care, client contact, or touching surfaces.
- I'd use appropriate PPE, such as gloves, masks, and apron, and dispose of PPE properly after use.
  - For instance, I'd wear a mask if the client got sick.
  - I'd wear shoe covers to avoid carrying germs from the outside.
- I'd (regularly) clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces, client areas, and equipment to reduce the risk of infection spread.
- I'd observe the client for signs of infection (fever, cough, or red skin), and document and report it to my supervisor immediately.
- I'd avoid touching my eyes, nose, or mouth during the service period.
- During my daily routine, I'd stay healthy, avoid working when sick, and keep vaccinations up to date.

### What would you do in an emergency situation?

1. The first thing I'd do is stay calm.
2. I'd check the environment, remove any hazards that may cause further harm, to ensure both the client and I are safe.
3. I'd avoid moving the client directly unless it’s unsafe to stay (like in a fire).
4. I'd apply basic first aid and follow the DRSABCD action plan if appropriate.
5. If the situation is serious, like the client is unresponsive or has a suspected heart attack, I'd call 000 for emergency services immediately. If the situation is under control and the client is able and safe to move, I'd help them stand up, using proper manual handling techniques (like supporting their arm or using a transfer belt). <!-- 如果客户摔倒且身体状况良好，再补充前面这句话 -->
6. I'd keep the client comfortable and offer reassurance by talking to them to reduce their anxiety.
7. I'd keep monitoring to prevent the client's condition from getting worse until the emergency services arrived.
8. I'd document and report the incident to my supervisor and share with the authorized colleagues to keep them informed to prevent this kind of incident in the future if necessary.

### What would you do if the client ask you to do something?

- 史密斯太太要求你清洁吊扇。你会怎么做
- 如果客户要求你做一些超出你职责范围的事情，你会怎么做

1. The first thing I'd do is to assess whether the task is within my Scope of Practice (like providing medical treatments). This can be done by reviewing the client's individualised support plan, my job description, and the employer's policies.
2. If the task is within my role, I'd perform it while ensuring following the requirements and procedures, like wearing PPE.
3. If the task is outside my role, I'd explain it to the client. I'd suggest an appropriate solution within my role if possible, such as helping the client access the right support, like contacting a nurse or family member.
4. If I'm not sure whether should I perform the task, I'd report it to my supervisor for advice.
5. I'd document the request in the client's records.
6. I'd continue to provide care within my role, ensuring the client feels supported and respected while their request is addressed appropriately.

### Handle Refusal

1. I'd stay calm and respect the client’s right to make choices.
2. I'd ask gentle questions to find out why they’re refusing, sometimes refusal means something wrong with their physical or mental health, or event the care we provided.
3. I'd explain the purpose of the support and the potential risks of their refusal.
4. I'd check the client’s care plan to find out how to handle refusals.
5. I'd offer options to give them control and reduce tension. For instance, if they refuse to shower, I might say, “Would you like to freshen up with a washcloth instead, or maybe later today?”.
6. I'd give them some time then check back later, or when they feel relaxed or in a good mood, ask again if they’re ready for service.
7. If the refusal impacts their safety or health, I'd document and report it to my supervisor, and maybe share with the authorized colleagues to keep them informed if necessary.

### Handle Challenging Situations

- Situation: During my placement, I experienced a challenging situation that I was assisting a client who was living with dementia to have a shower in the afternoon. During the task, the client became very agitated and showed strong resistance, pushing my hands away.
- Task: My task was to ensure the client's safety and dignity, and find a way to complete the care without making the situation worse.
- Action: I followed these steps to manage the situation:

  1. I explained each step before I did it.
  2. When the client became agitated, I stopped the care and stepped back to give him some space.
  3. I tried to find out the reason for the challenge. I realized the water might have been cold, or maybe I moved my hands too quickly, so I adjusted the water temperature and used gentle touch to comfort him, and distracted him by turning on his favorite music.
  4. After finishing the care, I covered him with a dry, warm towel to maintain his dignity and reported the incident to my supervisor.

- Result: The result was I successfully completed the care. From this experience, I learned that using patience and flexibility is an effective way to care for people with dementia, and safety is always built on a person-centred approach.

### Work with clients from different cultural backgrounds

I don’t have direct experience with clients from different culture backgrounds, but if I have a chance to work with them, I'll follow these steps.

- Before starting the care, I'll check the client’s care plan for cultural, language, or religious needs. If the plan is incomplete, I'll seek general knowledge about their preferences.
- I'll listen patiently and communicate effectively with the client. I'll never assume their needs based on their cultural backgrounds. I'll ask open-ended questions to encourage them to share their specific needs. For example, "How do you prefer to receive your personal care?"
- I'll use their feedback to adjust the care I delivered. This might mean modifying meal choices, ensuring privacy for prayer, or respecting their preference for a male or female carer.
- I'll document the client's specific needs and adaptations, and report it to my supervisor if I have any concerns. This ensures the whole team provides consistent and safe support.

### How do you handle multiple clients' in one busy shift?

- When supporting multiple clients in one shift, I prioritize tasks based on safety, urgency, and the clients’ care plans.
- I start by reviewing the care plan and identify urgent or high-risk tasks.
- I prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance. For instance, tasks like managing medical needs or addressing immediate health concerns take top priority to prevent risks.
- Then I focus on tasks with fixed schedules, like medication or meal times, to maintain clients’ expectations.
- I check in with each client to understand their immediate needs or preferences. This helps me adjust priorities if someone needs urgent attention.
- If working in a team, I coordinate with the team to divide tasks efficiently.
- I remain flexible in case unexpected situations arise, such as a client feeling unwell, and re-prioritize tasks as needed while keeping all clients’ needs in mind.
- I document and report any concerns to my supervisor and keep team informed to maintain continuous care.

### Support I hope from the employer

- I hope for regular training, such as handling clients with complex health issues and using specialized tools.
- I hope for essential care tools, such as PPE, mobility aids, and basic medical supplies (like thermometers).
- I hope for safety measures, such as providing support for high-risk tasks (having a second staff member for client transfers).
- I hope for timely and detailed information, such as client care plans, schedule changes, and feedback from clients/families.
- I hope for supervisor support, so I can consult when facing tricky situations.

### Handle client's complaint or feedback

- I stay calm and listen carefully about the client's concerns without interrupting and show empathy, so they feel heard and respected.
- I acknowledge their feelings and apologize, then clarify the problem by asking gentle questions to make sure I fully understand their concern.
- I take immediate steps to resolve it if possible, while ensuring aligning with the client’s individualised support plan and following workplace policies.
- If the complaint is complex or beyond my scope of practice, I document and report it to my supervisor.
- I check with the client later to ensure they’re satisfied with the resolution.
- Actually, complaints and feedback are important, cause they help me improve the care and prevent similar issues in the future.

### Work as part of a team

- I share updates and client information with my team, like nurses or supervisors, using clear words to ensure everyone knows what’s happening.
- I listen carefully to my teammates’ ideas or feedback, respecting their views to make sure we work well together and support clients.
- I help with tasks like personal care or cleaning, taking on my share and offering help to others when needed to keep the team on track.
- I stick to the client’s care plan and team instructions, ensuring my work matches the team’s goals and Aged Care Quality Standards.
- If I notice a client’s health change or a problem, I tell my supervisor right away, giving clear details to keep the team informed.
- I show up on time and complete my tasks well, so my team can trust me to do my part in caring for clients.
- I keep a friendly attitude, even during busy shifts, to create a good team environment and make work easier for everyone.
- I ask for advice or training from teammates to improve my skills, helping the team provide better care together.

### How do you handle conflict with colleagues? 

As a Support Worker, I think there are two kinds of conflicts: conflict with clients or their families and conflict with colleagues. I'll give two examples of how I handle these two different situations.

#### 1. Conflict with Clients or Their Family

Situation: During my placement, I provided mobility assistance for a client living with dementia who had limited mobility. His wife was dissatisfied with the walking time we provided. She believed we should increase her husband's daily activity.

Task: My task was to address her concerns and ensure the client's safety while finding a safe and reasonable way to adjust the client's walking time.

Action:
I took these steps:

- First, I stayed calm. I listened to her carefully without arguing and showed understanding for her concerns.
- I used de-escalating techniques: I kept a gentle tone, maintained a comfortable distance, and focused on the issue rather than emotions.
- I explained our current plan: “We walk him 20 minutes twice a day in the morning and afternoon, but we’re happy to explore adjustments if it’s safe.”
- With the involvement of the nurse, we agreed to increase the client's walking time safely.
- I documented and reported the incident to my supervisor, and updated the client’s care plan.

Result: The result was that the client received more beneficial exercise safely and the wife was satisfied about the adjustment. From this experience, I learned the importance of communication and person-centered approaches.

#### 2. Conflict with Colleagues

Situation: Imagine I am working with a colleague in the kitchen, and they tell me they are too busy to complete the **light housekeeping** or **laundry and linen care** duties assigned to them. They ask me to do their tasks instead.

Task: My task is to ensure that all tasks are completed efficiently for client safety and comfort, but also to maintain professional **teamwork** without encouraging them to avoid their responsibilities.

Action:
I'd handle this privately and diplomatically

- I'd speak to my colleague alone and use a **calm** and **objective** tone. I'd focus on the tasks, not the person. I'd say: 'I understand you are busy, but the linen for Client X must be changed today for **infection prevention and control**.'
- I'd offer to **collaborate** by saying: 'If I finish **assisted feeding** for Client Y now, can we work together to finish the laundry quickly?' [2]
- If the essential tasks still cannot be completed, I'd **report** the time management issue to the supervisor. This is not about blame; it is about ensuring **client safety** is not compromised due to unfinished work." [5]

Result: By focusing on **collaboration** and **prioritizing** the client's needs (like infection control), we would complete the necessary tasks and maintain a professional working relationship.

Case 2: Conflict with a Colleague

Situation: During a busy shift, a colleague and I disagreed about tasks for a client. We both thought we should attend to the same client first. This led to tension and a brief argument between us.
Task: My task was to resolve the misunderstanding quickly so the client’s care would not be affected, and to maintain a respectful working relationship with my colleague.
Action:

  1. I asked my colleague if we could talk privately, away from the client.
  2. I listened to her concerns, then calmly explained why I had started the task.
  3. We realized there was confusion in our schedule, so we reviewed the care plan and decided who would do which tasks. 
  4. We agreed that I'd finish helping this client and she would start another urgent task.
  5. I thanked her for working together to find a solution.
Result: By communicating calmly and sharing tasks, we both felt respected and the client was helped promptly. The conflict was resolved professionally, and we learned to coordinate better to avoid confusion in future shifts.

### How do you build a good relationship with clients?

- I always treat clients with dignity, listening to their feelings and needs with a kind and patient attitude to make them feel valued.
- I use simple, friendly language and non-verbal cues like smiles or gestures, especially for clients with language barriers, to ensure they understand and feel comfortable.
- I take time to know their likes, dislikes, and background, such as asking about their favorite foods or hobbies, to personalize their care and build trust.
- I show up on time, follow their care plan, and keep promises, like preparing a meal they enjoy, so they know they can depend on me.
- I involve them in activities they love, like chatting about their favorite topics or helping with a hobby, to create positive, meaningful moments.
- I encourage their independence by offering choices, like asking if they prefer a shower now or later, showing I respect their decisions.
- I pay attention to their mood or health changes and adjust my approach, reporting concerns to my team to ensure their well-being.

For example, with a Chinese client, I might use my knowledge of their culture, like offering familiar dishes or greetings in Mandarin, to make them feel at home and strengthen our bond.

### How do you ensure clients’ safety?

Clients' safety is my highest priority. My approach is always based on the client's individualized support plan and following professional standards and procedures.

- For physical and environmental safety, I try to prevent physical injury, especially falls. I regularly check the environment for any hazards that may cause harm, like wet floors, clutter, or loose rugs, to make sure the environment is safe. I use the correct and safe techniques and equipment when providing ambulation assistance.
- For clinical and health safety, I follow the infection control procedures to ensure the client's safety and health. I manage medication reminders and communicate with the nurse about the client’s health status.
- For dignity and emotional safety, I ask for permission before providing care and respect their privacy. If a client becomes distressed or aggressive, I try to understand the cause of their distress and redirect them to a safe activity.
- I document and report things like incidents, safety concerns, or changes in clients' condition to the nurse or my supervisor. This ensures the whole team to provide safe and consistent care.

### How do you ensure clients’ dignity?

Ensuring clients' dignity is the highest priority. This is the core requirement of Aged Care Quality Standard. To me, dignity means treating clients as individuals and helping them maintain control over their life.

- To respect autonomy and choice, I ensure the client has autonomy by following the principles of Person-Centred Care (PCC). I ask for permission before providing care and respect their privacy. I give simple choices whenever possible, for example: 'Would you like to have your shower now or in 30 minutes?' This helps them feel in control.
- To protect privacy, I'm conscientious about protecting client's privacy, especially during personal care. When assisting with personal hygiene, I ensure close the door and pull the curtains to give them privacy. I make sure that their body is covered with a towel or gown as much as possible to protect their comfort and modesty.
- To value identity and culture, Dignity is also about respecting who the person is. I ensure their identity, culture, and diversity are respected. I never make assumptions about their needs. Instead, I check their care plan and ask open-ended questions about their preferences regarding their diet, religious practices, or if they prefer a male or female carer. I always speak to them with a calm and polite tone, using their preferred name, to make them feel heard and valued.

By focusing on these steps, I ensure that the client is safe, respected, and treated with the dignity they deserve.

### How do you handle client's confidential or sensitive information?

For me, protecting client’s confidential or sensitive information is important for providing safe and professional care. I follow all workplace policies, the Privacy Act, and the organisation’s confidentiality rules.

- I treat all client information as confidential.
- If a client tells me personal or sensitive information, I listen respectfully and keep it private.
- I only share client information with authorized personnel on a need-to-know basis, and I never discuss them in public areas.
- I make sure all documents and notes are handled properly — for example, keeping care records secure, logging out of computer systems, and not leaving paperwork unattended.
- If the information impacts clients' safety and health, such as abuse or health concerns, I document and report it to my supervisor.
- I’m always mindful of privacy in the physical environment — speaking quietly, not discussing clients in public areas, and making sure conversations happen in private spaces.
- Overall, confidentiality means respecting the client, protecting their dignity, and ensuring their information is always safe and used only for their care.

### What would you do if you noticed signs of abuse or neglect?

- 如果看到同事对客户粗鲁，应该怎么做
- 如果你注意到虐待或疏忽的迹象，应该怎么做

1. **Ensure Client Safety**: I'd make sure the client is safe. If there’s immediate danger, I'd take appropriate action, such as removing the client from harm.
2. **Observe and Identify Signs**: I'd carefully observe any physical, emotional, or behavioral signs of abuse or neglect, ensuring I have clear and accurate details without jumping to conclusions.
3. **Document and Report**: I'd document and report the incident to my supervisor immediately. I’d provide factual details about what I observed without making assumptions, focusing on the co-worker’s actions and the client’s well-being.
4. **Follow Mandatory Reporting Process**: If the situation involves serious abuse or neglect, I know aged care workers in Australia are required to report it under the Aged Care Act. I’d follow the Mandatory Reporting process, report it to the appropriate authorities, like Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission.
5. **Support the Client**: I'd offer emotional support to the client, listening to their concerns and ensuring they feel safe and respected.
6. **Follow Up**: I'd check in with my supervisor to ensure the issue is being addressed and offer any further assistance needed to support the client’s well-being.

What Would You Do If You Suspected Abuse Or Neglect?
If I suspected abuse or neglect, I'd stay calm, ensure the immediate safety of the client, and follow safeguarding procedures.
I'd not confront the alleged abuser or promise confidentiality to the victim.
Instead, I'd record the facts objectively—what I saw, heard, or was told—and report the concern to my designated safeguarding lead or manager without delay.
If the client was in immediate danger, I'd contact emergency services.
Acting swiftly and responsibly is crucial to protecting vulnerable individuals.
I take every concern seriously and understand it is my duty to report, not to investigate.

### How do you ensure clear communication with clients who have communication difficulties?

- 确保与有沟通障碍的客户进行清晰的沟通
- 如何照顾一个不会说英文（not speak English）的老人
- 如何与帕金森（dementia）或者听力障碍（hearing difficulties）的人沟通

1. **Review Care Plan**: I review the client’s care plan to understand their specific communication challenges, such as dementia or speech difficulties.
2. **Use Simple Language**: I speak slowly and clearly, using short and simple sentences to make it easy for clients to understand.
3. **Use Body Language**: I use body language, facial expressions, eye contact to support clients with hearing loss or cognitive challenges.
4. **Use Visual Aids**: I use pictures, notes, or communication boards to support clients with speech or hearing difficulties.
5. **Be Patient**: I give clients time to respond and reduce stress.
6. **Confirm Understanding**: I ask yes/no or observe clients reactions to ensure they understand.
7. **Involve Support**: I may ask my supervisor for advice, consult family for preferences, or use interpreters for non-English and Mandarin speakers if needed.
8. **Document and Report**: I document effective methods and report changes in care notes, ensuring the team is informed.

### What to do if the guest is impatient when seeing a doctor?

- 看病、外出就餐时等待很久，客人不耐烦怎么办
- 周边环境嘈杂怎么办

- I stay calm.
- I ensure immediate safety — find a seat, remove hazards, fasten seatbelt or help them sit if needed.
- I acknowledge their feeling, explain briefly and simply what’s happening.
<!-- - Offer two simple choices (gives control): e.g. “Would you like to wait in the waiting room or sit in the car for a few minutes?” -->
- I distracted the client by chatting with them.
- If at a clinic, let staff know the client is anxious — they may be able to prioritize or fast-track.
- If impatience risks safety (agitation, trying to leave into traffic), move to a safer place and seek help from clinic staff or call your supervisor.
- After the visit, document the incident and inform your supervisor/family if relevant; update the care plan with strategies that helped.
- Preventive steps for next time: allow extra travel/appointment time, give regular time warnings (“we leave in 10 minutes”), schedule quieter appointment times, bring a familiar object or activity.

### How do you safely transport a patient?

**Check Care Plan**: I'd review the client’s care plan to know their mobility needs, like if they use a wheelchair or need extra support.
**Prepare Vehicle and Equipment**: I ensure the vehicle is safe, check wheelchair locks or seat belts, and use aids like transfer belts if needed.
**Use Safe Techniques**: I'd follow manual handling procedures, bending my knees and moving slowly, to help the client in and out of the vehicle safely.
**Communicate Clearly**: I'd explain each step to keep the client calm, aware, and reduce stress.
**Monitor During Transport**: I'd watch for signs of discomfort or distress while driving, ensuring the client's is safety and comfort.
**Report Issues**: If any thing unexpected happened, I'd document and report it to my supervisor.

## 专业题

### Activities of Daily Living, ADLs

Activities of Daily Living, or ADLs, are the essential tasks people need to do every day to take care of themselves and live independently. These include personal care tasks like Personal Hygiene, Dressing, Eating, Toileting, Mobility, and Continence care. As a support worker, my role is to assist clients with ADLs to maintain their comfort, dignity, and independence, especially if they have physical or cognitive limitations.

### Duty of Care

#### What is duty of care?

Duty of care is our most important legal and ethical responsibility as a Support Worker. It means we have an obligation to take reasonable action to ensure the clients' safety, health, and well-being, and to protect them from harm that could be reasonably foreseen.

#### How do you practice duty of care?

- I must ensure the client's environment is safe and follow manual handling procedures when lifting or moving a client to prevent falls or injuries to them and myself.
- I must ensure the client's dignity, privacy, and quality of life while providing care, such as ensuring curtains are closed during personal care.
- I must follow the client's care plan and the facility's Work Health and Safety (WHS) procedures.
- If I see a change in a client's health (like a new bruise, fever, or confusion), I have a duty to report it to my supervisor or the Registered Nurse. Otherwise, it is a breach of my duty of care.

#### What is the relevance of duty of care in aged care?

A duty of care outlines standards of reasonable and appropriate care. It also provides a legal basis for determining how to make the best decisions regarding the care of a person with disability.

<!-- Reference: Reference: CHCDIS020 -->

#### Support workers' duty of care

Support workers' duty of care includes eight obligations:

- Providing safe and high-quality service
- Treating people with dignity and respect
- Preventing abuse and neglect
- Protecting people's privacy
- Informing people about their care
- Helping people maintain independence

### Dignity of Risk

#### What is dignity of risk?

Dignity of risk means respecting client's right to make choices, even if these choices involve possible risks.

#### What is the support worker's duty of care in relation to dignity of risk?

It is the disability support worker’s duty of care to ensure that the person they are supporting is able to live their life however they choose while maintaining their health and safety (as far as reasonably practicable).

<!-- Reference: CHCDIS020 -->

#### Examples to reduce the risks

Support workers can develop ways to honour clients' dignity of risk while protecting their well-being. Here are some ways to reduce the risks:

- Situation: A person wants to continue living alone despite their mobility issues.
- Result: They may hurt themselves without anyone there to help them.
- Suggestions:
  - Ask them to always keep an emergency cell phone with them. They can use it to call for help in case of emergencies.
  - Schedule more frequent check-ins and home visits.
  - Ask one of their neighbours to check in on them at least once a day.
  
- Situation: A person wants to continue using a cane instead of a wheelchair.
- Result: There is a greater risk of falling and injury when using a cane.
- Suggestions:
  - Ask them if they agree to have physical therapy to strengthen their arms and legs. This would make it safer for them to use a cane because they will be more stable.
  - Make sure they have a sturdy, stable, and comfortable cane to use.

- Situation: A person does not want to receive a flu vaccine.
- Result: They are at a higher risk of a serious flu infection.
- Suggestions:
  - Monitor their health more closely.
  - Minimise their potential exposure to the flu.

### Individualised Plan

#### What is an individualised plan?

individualised plans detail an old person’s medical and care information and what services or lifestyle modifications they may need to address their individual needs.

Individual plans are vital because they are tailored to each person. It ensures that older people do not just receive generic services that do not fit their needs. It also enables them to decide when and how to receive services.

#### Contents

A person’s individualised plan contains the following information:

- Basic information
- Current medical needs
- Care needs
- Goals and preferences
- Members of care team
- Services being availed
- Assessment results
- Family or carer contact information

#### Purpose

Individualised plan serves as a guide.

A person’s individualised plan serves the following purposes:

- Tells the team basic and medical information about the person
- Tells each aged care worker what to do for the person and when to do it
- Serves as a record of the person’s goals and progress
- Serves as an agreement between the person and the care provider

### Mandatory Reporting

#### What is Mandatory Reporting?

Mandatory reporting is a legal obligation to report any reasonable belief of abuse to the proper authorities. Any person with a duty of care over a person with disability must determine whether the person with disability needs immediate help or is suffering from significant harm.

Mandatory reporting is the responsibility of reporting suspected instances of abuse. Professionals like teachers, medical workers and care workers all have this responsibility. When it comes to aged care, mandatory reporting enables older people to be protected from indicators and allegations of exploitation, abuse, harassment and neglect. 

As an aged care worker, you should know the mandatory reporting laws that apply to aged care. Familiarise yourself with the reporting policies and procedures of your workplace. This will help you protect the rights of the older people in your care.

The Aged Care Act 1997 defines a reportable incident as the occurrence, or suspected occurrence, of abuse, including: 

- Unreasonable use of force
- Unlawful sexual contact or inappropriate sexual conduct
- Psychological or emotional abuse
- Stealing done by an aged care worker
- Unexpected death of the residential care recipient
- Neglect
- Unreasonable use of restrictive practices
- Unexplained absence of the residential care recipient from the residential care services of the provider

Aged care workers must report these cases to the proper authorities. Aged care providers must respond to these reports quickly and efficiently. There must be a record of each report, including what was done to address it.

Mandatory reporting is related to your duty of care as an aged care worker. You must ensure that any reasonable belief of abuse to the older person you are supporting is reported to the proper authorities. 

If you have spotted any indicator of abuse or neglect in the older person, reach out immediately for help from authorities. Remember that mandatory reporting plays a vital role in preventing and stopping the harm that abuse, harassment and neglect can bring to older people.

#### What is the support workers duty of care in relation to mandatory reporting?

Its role is to enable persons with disability to be protected from indicators and allegations of exploitation, abuse, harassment, and neglect.

### What is building good boundaries?

Building good boundaries means setting clear, respectful limits in my work with clients to stay professional, keep them safe, and protect their dignity, as per Australian aged care standards.

- **Stay Professional**: I keep a friendly but not personal relationship, avoiding sharing my own problems or getting too close, to maintain trust and focus on care.
- **Respect Client Privacy**: I only discuss client details with authorized staff, like nurses, and avoid talking about their needs in public to protect their privacy.
- **Follow Role Limits**: I stick to my support worker tasks, like personal care or cleaning, and don’t do things outside my training, like giving medication, to stay safe.
- **Communicate Clearly**: I explain what I can do, like “I can help with your shower now,” and respect client choices to keep boundaries clear and professional.

How Do You Manage Personal Boundaries In Your Role?
<!-- I manage personal boundaries by maintaining a clear distinction between professional responsibilities and personal relationships.
I treat clients with empathy and respect while avoiding over-involvement or favoritism.
I follow care plans, respect client privacy, and never share personal information unless necessary for care coordination.
If a client becomes overly attached or makes inappropriate requests, I respond with kindness but redirect the interaction professionally.
I also seek guidance from supervisors when necessary.
Maintaining boundaries protects both the client and myself, ensuring a safe and ethical working environment while fostering healthy and supportive care relationships. -->

How do you ensure accurate documentation and record keeping?
<!-- I understand the importance of accurate documentation for client safety and care continuity.
I record all observations, activities, medication administration, and incidents promptly and clearly, using the correct formats and systems.
I avoid assumptions, stick to factual descriptions, and ensure records are up to date and confidential.
If I notice any changes in a client’s health or behavior, I document and report them immediately.
I regularly review care plans to stay aligned with the client’s needs.
By being diligent and detail-oriented, I support high-quality care and ensure legal and professional standards are met. -->

### What do you know about manual handling in aged care?

问题：你对搬运技巧了解多少？

Manual handling in aged care is about safely moving or supporting clients, like helping them walk, sit, or get out of bed. It also includes moving objects, like lifting a chair or carrying supplies.

1. **Assess the Situation**: Before moving a client, I’d check their care plan for mobility needs or restrictions, like if they need a walker or have a recent injury. I’d also assess the environment for hazards, like clutter or wet floors, to ensure it’s safe.
2. **Communicate with the Client**: I’d explain what I’m doing to make them feel comfortable, saying, “I’m going to help you stand now – let me know if anything feels off.” I’d ask if they’re ready and encourage them to do as much as they can to maintain independence.
3. **Use Proper Techniques**: I’d use techniques from my training, like bending my knees, keeping my back straight, and holding the client close to my body for stability. For example, when helping someone stand, I’d support them under their arms, not pulling on their wrists.
4. **Use Equipment When Needed**: If a client needs more support, I’d use aids like hoists, slide sheets, or transfer belts, following the facility’s training. For instance, with a hoist, I’d check it’s in good condition and position it correctly before lifting.
5. **Work as a Team**: For complex transfers, like moving a client from bed to a wheelchair, I’d ask a colleague for help if the care plan requires two people. I’d coordinate by saying, “Let’s lift on three – ready?”
6. **Monitor and Adjust**: I’d watch for signs of discomfort during the task and stop if the client seems in pain. If something doesn’t work, I’d try a different approach or consult my supervisor. For example, if a client struggles to stand, I’d check if they need a different aid.
7. **Document and Report**: After assisting, I’d record any issues, like if the client felt unsteady, in their care notes. If I notice a new mobility concern, I’d report it to my supervisor to update the care plan.
8. **Follow Training and Policies**: I’d stick to the manual handling training from my Certificate III and the facility’s policies, which align with Australia’s Work Health and Safety regulations and Aged Care Standards. If I’m unsure, I’d ask for a refresher or guidance.

During my placement, I helped clients with tasks like transferring from bed to chair using a slide sheet or supporting them while walking with a walker. My steady personality helps me stay focused, and my habit of keeping spaces tidy ensures the environment is clear of trip hazards. I also prioritize the client’s dignity, making sure they feel secure and respected during any manual handling task.

### If you are hired, what do you hope to learn from this job?

If I get this job, I want to get better at helping clients, like learning more about personal care or dealing with tricky moments. I’d love to take training, like for dementia, and work with the team to give safe, kind care. This job will teach me how to understand clients better and make their lives happier, which I really care about.

How Do You Communicate With Non-Verbal Or Hearing-Impaired Clients?
I adapt my communication methods based on the client’s abilities.
Use gestures, facial expressions, picture cards, or written communication
I observe body language closely and maintain eye contact to gauge responses.
Speak clearly, face them directly, and use simple language.
If they use hearing aids, I check that they are functioning.
I may also learn basic sign language or consult with family members about preferred communication methods.
My goal is to ensure they feel understood, included, and respected, regardless of their communication challenges.

### What's the difference between Home Care and Residential Aged Cared?

The main difference between Home Care and Residential Aged Care is where the care is provided and how much support the client needs.

**Home Care**

Home care supports clients in their own homes, helping them stay independent for as long as possible. Clients usually have lower to moderate care needs. As a support worker, tasks often include:

- ADLs, such as personal hygiene, mobility and meal preparation
- Transport to appointments
- Housework
- Social support and companionship

In home care, support workers usually support one client at a time, and care is based on the client’s needs and routines.

**Residential Aged Care** / **Nursing Home Care**

Residential aged care is provided in a facility, like nursing home, for people with higher or complex care needs who can no longer live safely at home. Clients may need:

- 24/7 supervision
- Assistance with most ADLs
- Work closely within a multidisciplinary team (clinical care from nurses)

Support workers in residential aged care often work as part of a larger team, supporting multiple residents during a shift and following care plans and safety procedures.

**Summary**

In short, home care focuses on independence and support in the client’s own home, while residential aged care provides higher-level, continuous care in a facility. In both settings, the goal is the same: to ensure safety, health, wellbeing, and quality of life through person-centred care.
